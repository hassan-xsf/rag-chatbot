**Introduction** The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted at the United Nations Summit in New York from 25 to 27 September 2015. The Agenda is a broad and universal policy agenda, with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with 169 associated targets which are integrated and indivisible. Building on the [Millennium Development Goals](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/<http:/www.un.org/millenniumgoals/>) (MDGs), the 2030 Agenda seeks to guide Member States to transform their approach to achieve inclusive, people-centered and sustainable development with no one left behind. We recognize that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan. We are resolved to free the human race from the domination of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. We are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets which we are announcing today demonstrate the scale and ambition of this new universal Agenda. They seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what these did not achieve. They seek to realize the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social and environmental. The inter-linkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realized. If we realize our ambitions across the full extent of the Agenda, the lives of all will be profoundly improved and our world will be transformed for the better.

####  History of SMI
###### Glorious Past
###### ![](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/hassanally-effendi.jpg)
###### Foundation by Hassanally Effendi:
Sindh Madressatul Islam was founded on 1st September 1885 by a group of enlightened Muslims of Sindh, led by Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi, as the first modern Muslim educational institution of Sindh, whose doors were open to everyone irrespective of their religious affiliations.
After end of the Mughul era in the subcontinent and annexation of Sindh by the British by the middle of nineteenth century, the Muslims in Sindh were not ready to accept the new system of education. This closed doors of social, economic and political development on them. This took its toll and by early 1880s the majority Muslim community in Sindh had degenerated to an abysmally low economic, social and political standing. It may be interesting to note that when the University of Bombay conducted the matriculation examination in Sindh for the first time in 1870, not a single Muslim student passed it, though Muslims constituted seventy-five percent of Sindh’s population.
Around this time an internal reformation movement amongst Muslims of India began. Three greatest proponents of this movement were Sir Syed Ahmed Khan of Aligarh in the North, Justice Syed Amir Ali of Calcutta in the East and Hassanally Effendi in the South-West. They employed education as tool for bringing social reformation. Hassanally Effendi took up the cause of establishment of Sindh Madressatul Islam, to which both Sir Syed and Justice Amir Ali extended fullest support including financial assistance.
The opening of Sindh Madressah proved to be harbinger of change for betterment amongst the Muslims of Sindh. Students from all over the region started flocking to this institution. Though SMI was founded primarily for the benefit of Muslims, its doors were equally open to followers of all other religions. Early records show that around ten percent students of SMI were always from non-Muslim communities. In addition to non-Muslim students, SMI also had several non-Muslim teachers on its payroll. This multicultural and liberal atmosphere helped in creating a cosmopolitan culture within the institution.
###### Association with Quaid-e-Azam M.A. Jinnah
###### ![](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/quaid-e-azam-m-a-jinnah.jpg)
In July 1887, less than two years of Sindh Madressah’s establishment, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah got enrolled in the institution and studied here for the longest period of his academic life, from 1887 to 1892. He carried deep imprints of SMI on his mind throughout his life, which is evident from the fact that he bequeathed one-third of his personal property to Sindh Madressah through his last will. He also elevated his alma-mater from school to college level. He personally came to inaugurate “Sindh Madressah College” on 21st June 1943. On that occasion he was overcome by his sentiments. Speaking in a reminiscent mood, he declared before his audience that he knew every inch of the splendid grounds of the institution where he had studied and played as a schoolboy fifty five years earlier. “Every inch of these splendid grounds where I took part in various games, I know” Daily Morning News and Daily Star of India quoted him.
###### Alma Mater of Freedom Fighters:
In addition to Quaid-e-Azam, Sindh Madressah has educated several leading lights of firstly struggle for separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency and subsequently of Pakistan movement, including Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, Sir Abdullah Haroon, Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, Khan Bahadur Mohammad Ayub Khuhro, Shaikh Abdul Majid Sindhi and others. It was in this background that Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah, an alumnus of SMI and renowned educationist used to call SMI “Child of Sindh and Mother of Pakistan.” Besides the freedom fighters SMI has produced great educationists, jurists, soldiers and men of letters: some of them are: Allama I.I. Kazi, Allama Umer Bin Mohammad Daudpota, A.K. Brohi, Ali Ahmed Brohi, Lt Gen Ghulam Mohammad Malik and several others who constitute its proud Roll-of-Honor.
After the demise of Quaid-e-Azam, SMI witnessed a period of decline due to indifferent attitude of the private management board that ran the affairs of the institution at that time. The first casualty was the scheme of Boarding Houses (hostels), disconnecting the link of the institution with rest of the province and beyond. This was followed by constructing long rows of shops on the prime-most land given for the sole purpose of education, in utter disregard of aesthetics as well as respect for the philosophy of education. Slowly and gradually, the institution lost its grandeur and by 1972 it had been reduced to a non-descript local school from an institution of international repute.

###### Vice Chancellor’s Message
It gives natural vibrations to my hands and sensations to my mind when to write about this august university i.e. Sindh Madressatul Islam University, Karachi. This is the institute credited with production of wise persons, visionary leaders, freedom fighters, educationists and founders, viz: Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, Sir Abdullah Haroon, Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, Khan Bahadur Mohammad Ayub Khuhro, Allama I.I. Kazi, Allama Umer Bin Mohammad Doudpota, Hanif Muhammad and to my groomer i.e. my father father Taj Muhammad Sahrai. 
The Sindh Madressatul Islam (SMI) was established in 1885 by the legend Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi. The institute was founded in the limelight of ten years’ older institute Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College by none other than Sir Syed Ahmad Khan; a great reformist of the sub-continent.
In recent times the SMIU has emerged as one of the modern university which provides the tertiary education in the market driven programs, i.e., Artificial Intelligence and Mathematical Sciences, Accounting, Banking and Finance, Business Administration, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Media and Communication Studies, Environmental Sciences, Social Development, Education and English, to meet the challenging and competitive scenario of 21st century. These offered academic programs are equipped and strengthened with quality of faculty and state of art facilities, i.e. Television Studio, FM Radio Station, Air-conditioned class rooms and Auditorium with SMD Wall.
Indeed, it is a fact that the referred programs reflect the strengths of the university as well as offer threat to be competitive and sustainable under the philosophy of SWOT analysis. It is therefore important to understand the dynamics of the 21st century and my Customer-Product Students’ concept which I presented at Euro Asia Rector Conference, “You receive the student as a customer and see off him / her as a product.” It is therefore we have to ensure to impart quality education, inbreeding the youth with values of life, implication of social justice, pluralism, gender neutrality, diversity and inclusion and last not least the provision of financial assistance on merit-cum-need basis.
It is matter of pleasure to inform that besides maintaining the colonial architect, the University is looking forward to have new six-storey IT tower building, 100-acres campus at Education City at Malir and 10-acres campus in Hawksbay area. Further details of the university including academic programs and administration hierarchy are provided in this prospectus.
At the end, I myself and on behalf of my faculty and staff, consciously promise that we will put all our efforts and hard work to make you such a useful product and a global responsible citizen that shall matters to Sindh, Pakistan and beyond our national borders.
God bless us. 
Pakistan Paindabad.

![](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/khan-bahadur-hassanally.jpg)
Hassanally Effendi was born on 14th August 1830 in a respectable family of Akhunds in Hyderabad, Sindh. While still very young, he lost his father and was brought up by his elder brother. According to the tradition of his family, he was enrolled in a local maktab to read holy Quran and learn Arabic and Persian. After completion of this traditional education, he got a job in the office of the Deputy Collector of Naushehro. There he developed friendship with one of his Christian colleague who encouraged him to learn English.
By that time, a vast majority of Muslims had kept themselves aloof from everything related to English, including their language. But, Hassanally held a different point of view. He thought that there was immense wealth of literature and knowledge in English, which ought to be untapped for the intellectual and material progress of the Muslims. He was of the view that the language was merely means of communication and it had nothing to do with the acts of those who spoke it. Hence,
he devoted his leisure hours in learning English and acquired proficiency in it. As he came across great works of English literature, he became very fond of reading, which became his hobby.
This was the time when river Indus served as means of transportation, as roads had yet not been developed and land routes were insecure. The British established ‘Indus-Flotilla’ a system of transportation based on a special type of boats. The town of Jherrick, a river-port some sixty miles north of Karachi, emerged as the headquarters of the Indus Flotilla. This establishment had a core permanent staff as to keep an account of the incoming and outgoing quantities of goods. Hassanally was offered a job, which he joined as it offered him relatively more time for his passion: reading English literature.
Sometime in the mid 1860s when Hassanally was about thirty-five he met Mr. Middleton, the chief judge of the highest court in the province of Sindh called the ‘Saddar Court.’ The judge had arrived for crossing Indus by a ferry. However, the judge decided to spend the night at port and to cross the river the following day. After dinner when everybody retired, he saw Hassanally reading an English book by the dim light of an oil lamp. After the introductions were over, a conversation ensued. The judge was pleasantly surprised to know about the grasp of Hassanally on a variety of subjects. He was even more surprised to know that the person he was talking to was a Muslim.
The judge needed a person at his court who knew local languages and was well versed with Muslim customs and practices, as the court faced immense difficulties in understanding the contents of applications filed by Muslims in local languages. He had been looking for a person to assist the court especially in the matters relating to Muslims but was unable to find such a person as there was not even a single English-knowing Muslim available for that job in the entire province. But now in Hassanally he found a perfect match for his need and offered him immediately an appointment in his court at Karachi on almost double of Hassanally’s existing salary. He accepted the offer and shifted to Karachi to assume his new responsibilities.
As they started working together, Hassanally impressed the judge with his legal acumen and grip over the finer points of law to such an extent that the judge got him special permission to practice law without even having a formal qualification in law. This proved to be a turning point in Hassanally’s life.
This was the time that there was not even single Muslim advocate except him in the entire Sindh. Most of the lawyers in Sindh were Hindus while some of them were Christians and Zoroastrians. In these circumstances he had no support base and had to prove his worth against well-established lawyers. But, he took it as a challenge and devoted each ounce of his energy to his new profession. His interest and devotion towards his job earned him respect in the legal fraternity and he was offered the most prestigious position of the Public Prosecutor of Sindh. The distinction of his appointment was that he was the first non-European lawyer in Sindh to be appointed to that position. Another distinction was that he held that office for fourteen years, setting a record.
Hassanally was a man of rare talents. He had a fairly good knowledge of foreign languages like Persian, Arabic, English, Turkish, Latin and French. He offered prayers regularly at proper times throughout his life. After mosques at Sindh Madressah were constructed, Hassanally made it a point to offer Friday prayers every week regularly there, the routine that he observed till his departing from this world.
In private life also, Hassanally observed proper routine throughout his life. In summer as well as in winter, he used to get up at five o’ clock in the morning. After having bath and offering prayers he used to read holy Quran. After that he went for a morning walk, where the news of the day was read to him. At nine o’clock he would engage himself in learning a foreign language and after that he would dress up and had his breakfast.
Hassanally did not allow any serious work to interfere with his sleep, which he considered the restorer of consumed energy. A full night’s rest always made him look fresh again in the morning and ready to go through the duties of the day with renewed vigor. This schedule helped him a lot not only keeping him healthy throughout his life, but also enabled him to contribute extraordinarily towards the causes he had chosen for himself to work for.
These habits greatly helped him in establishing himself in his profession. Once established, Hassanally directed his energies towards the greater cause of the welfare of his Muslim brethren, not only in Sindh and India but much beyond that. He founded an association under the name of ‘Anjuman-e-Islam’ and was elected its president. The main objective of the association was to help Muslims during the period of their sufferings, safeguard their rights and spread education amongst them.
At that time, a noted Hindu Lawyer Mr. Dayaram Jethamal had also organized an association known as ‘Sindh Sabha’ with the objectives of the promotion of education amongst Sindhis. Hassanally joined that association also without any prejudice and was elected as its Vice President.
Hassanally’s dream to establish Sindh Madressatul Islam come true on 01 September 1885, when Sindh Madressatul Islam was formally opened. A ceremony was arranged to mark the beginning of the institution, to which he invited a couple of friends and well wishers. Hassanally spoke for about two hours in that function in which he described the social and economic conditions of the Muslims of Sindh and the measures that he and his friends were taking to improve them.
By 1895, Hassanally Effendi and his friends in cause had turned the institution of Sindh Madressatul Islam into a center of excellence. It consisted of a high school, three primary branches of Sindhi, Urdu and Gujrati. In this institution, the Quran classes and religious instructions were taught regularly. A group of highly dedicated teachers had converted themselves in a spirited team around the dream of Hassanally Effendi. The institution had already started producing the generations of educated Sindhi Muslims, with the first batch of six students passing the examination conducted by the University of Bombay in 1892.
Having achieved his objectives successfully Hassanally breathed his last in the afternoon of 20th August 1895, at Hassanally Hall located on the McLeod Road (presently known as I.I. Chundrigar Road) of Karachi. At first it was contemplated that he should be buried in the compound of Sindh Madressah. But it was noted that he had always desired that he should be buried in the garden of his Hyderabad residence, known as Effendi Baugh. Respecting his desire his body was taken in a special train from Karachi to Hyderabad, where he was laid to rest amidst thousands of his friends, family members, teachers and students of SMI.
May Allah bless his noble soul! Courtesy: Hassanally Effendi (1830-1895): The Founder of Sindh Madressatul Islam by Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh

  2. Candidates can use noticeboards and classroom announcements for their canvassing from 3rd May 2025 with approval of their respective Coordinator/HoD, without disturbing their classes. 
  3. Candidates cannot display their banners/panaflex on the walls.
  4. Posters and pamphlets may also be used, however, they cannot be pasted anywhere on campus. 
  5. Stickers are not allowed to be pasted anywhere within university premises. However, you may get them printed and distribute amongst your voters. 
  6. At the end of the election process, it would be the responsibility of the winning team/selected office bearers to remove the canvassing material and safely return to the nominated candidates. 
  7. The elections shall be conducted in the designated area and no candidate shall be allowed to roam around or enter into the classes. Only the polling agents with their Student ID and CNIC will be present in the room to observe the overall elections activity. 


  1. Candidates as well as the voters are directed to observe the SMIU Code of Conduct. It is emphasized that the following instructions should be followed without fail:


  * No student is allowed to propagate the agenda of any political/religious party.
  * No student is allowed to propagate any sectarian activity.
  * No student can coerce/force/threaten any individual to cast a vote in anyone’s favor.
  * No student can bully any contestant to withdraw from elections.
  * No student is allowed wall-chalking.
  * No student shall vandalize / damage the university property. 
  * No candidate shall interfere with the campaign activities of another candidate. 
  * Campaign materials must not have designs, information or slogans which in any way damage the reputation of the university. 
  * No other logos except the university/respective Student Society logo may be used.


**_Note:_** These rules must be followed by each candidate and their respective campaign team members. It is further stated that the university management has the right to make amendments in the rules whenever required. 
If anyone is found to be breaching any of these regulations, appropriate action will be taken including, but not limited to, disqualification from the elections.

GPA = Sum over Courses in Semester (Course Credit Hours X Grade Point Earned)
Total Semester Credit Hours
CGPA = Sum over all taken Courses in all Semesters (Course Credit Hours X Grade Point Earned)
Total Credit Hours Taken in all Semesters
###### Course Grading System
Performance of the students in the examination shall be assessed on the basis of the marks obtained from a total of 100 marks in each course. The marks obtained shall be presented as Numerical Grade (N.G) and Alphabetical Grade (A.G) as explained below.
* Assessment of performance on the basis of marks out of 100 fixed for a course recommended in course outlines of different disciplines will be termed as Numerical Grade (NG). 
* Equivalent of numerical grade in terms of alphabets shall be termed as Alphabetical grades (AG) and each letter carries a value in terms of numerical points termed as Grade Point Average (GPA). 
* Over all grading for the declaration of result will be based on Gradation System for representing actual achievements of a candidate as follows: 
* Semester Grade Point Average (GPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Averages (CGPAs) will be calculated using the following relationships: 
###### Transfer Students
* Only a limited number of transfer students can be accepted each year. A maximum of 50% of courses are transferable. 
* Credits are transferred on course to course basis i.e. a person taking course A at University X is allowed to transfer his/her credits to SMIU provided that course A is equivalent to course B taught at the SMIU. 
* No credit hour of a course will be transferred if the grade is less than C for undergraduate and B for graduate. 
* SMIU may enroll students (if they fulfill their criteria) for any semester or for any single class and issue the students a transcript for the courses completed. 
* Credit hours may only be transferred between Chartered HEIs. 
* Student must have a regular admission in the Undergraduate program and should earn a minimum of 50% credit hours in order to received degree from SMIU.(For Credit Transfer Students) 
###### CGPA = Requirement for Completion of Undergraduates / Graduates Degrees
* For completion of the degree, the minimum qualifying CGPAs for BS and MS/ M. Phil Students are 2.2 and 2.5 respectively. 
###### Credit Hours for Undergraduate and Graduate Degrees
* A credit hour means teaching a theory course for one hour each week throughout the semester. 
* One credit hour in laboratory or practical work/project would require lab contact of at least two hours per week throughout the semester. 
* The credit hours are denoted by two digits within brackets with a hyphen in between. The first digit represents the theory part while the second (right side) digit represents the practical. 
* Thus 3(3-0) means three credit hours of theory, while 4(3-1) means a total of four credit hours, of which three are of theory while one credit hour is for laboratory or practical work. 
###### Plagiarism Policy
* Plagiarism is use of someone else’s idea, words, projects, artwork, phrasing, sentence structure, or other work without properly acknowledging the ownership (source) of the property. Plagiarism is dishonest because it misrepresents the work of someone else as one’s own. Students who are suspected of plagiarism will answer to an investigation. Those found guilty will face a disciplinary action as per the University rules. 
###### Penalties for Plagiarism
* When an act of plagiarism is found to have occurred, the “Disciplinary Committee” at SMIU in its recommendations, DEPENDING UPON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROVEN OFFENCE, will advise the Vice Chancellor SMIU, to take any one or a combination of the following disciplinary action(s) against the student(s) found guilty of the offence: 
* The offender may be expelled/ rusticated from the University and from joining any institution of Higher Education in Pakistan for a period as deemed appropriate by the “Disciplinary Committee”. A notice may be circulated among all academic institutions and research organization to this effect. 
* The offender may be given a failure grade in the subject. 
* The offender may be fined an amount as deemed appropriate. 
* The offender may be given a written warning if the offence is minor and is committed for the first time. 
* Any other penalty deemed fit by the “Disciplinary Committee”. 
* In the case of thesis the responsibility of plagiarism will be of the student and not of the supervisor or members of the Supervisory Committee. 
* The notification of the plagiarism by the author(s) may be published in the print media or may be publicized on different Websites at the discretion of the Vice Chancellor. 
* HEC or SMIU may debar the offender from sponsorship of research funding, travel grant, scholarship, fellowship or any other funded program for a period as deemed appropriate by the “Disciplinary Committee”.

###### SMIU Publications
SMIU has established embryonic SMI University Press with the prime objective of publishing scholarly works in order to promote scholarship across a wide range of disciplines. The emphasis is on publication of scholarly works relating to Pakistan. So far two books of international standard have been published by SMI University Press, while several others are in the pipeline.

**Introduction** With Covid-19 global pandemic and fear and uncertainties attached to it, it has become imperative that education institutes, especially seats of higher learning, shall ensure continuation of academic process to prevent academic loss of learners. In this view, under the guidance and leadership of the Honorable Vice Chancellor, SMI University has also planned to conduct online academic activities, with support from already placed state-of-the-art Learning Management System (LMS) and integrated Video Conferencing via third party applications. **Technology** LMS Learning Management System (LMS), already implemented at SMIU and being utilized by Students and faculty members alike for academic activities will be used to communicate and carry out the activities other than Video Conferencing. It can be utilized effectively to communicate class timings, issue notifications, upload assignments and all the other subsequent tasks. MS Teams HEC has a licensing agreement in place with Microsoft to utilize Microsoft Services, such as MS Office 365 which also includes MS Teams, at its associated universities. MS Teams, is a platform for teleconferencing (including audio and video), which can be used to conduct online classes. This platform easily used by faculty and staff like from all locations and thus can be used by maximum attendees. Zoom Zoom is a third-party application, focused towards teleconferencing and online meetings mainly. Although prior to the appearance of Covid-19 it was not much sought after, but since then it has established its repo as the solution of choice for many corporates and academic institutes. Basic Zoom services are subscribed for up to 15-20 users to seamlessly carry online classes. Zoom is also integrated with LMS to upload recordings of every session for easy access by students. **Synchronous Online Classes** Since classes do not have the limitation of a maximum number of students due to usual physical constraints under on-campus classes, we can have as many students in a single class as feasible. Hence it is proposed that different sections of a particular course being taught by same faculty members to be merged into a single class. A minimum criterion of 5-10 registrations (except Education, Social Development, Environmental Science), is set to start a class online. This is necessary as number of students are interested in and have the necessary resources to take the online class is different than that of number of students who actually enrolled in the course. Each class shall be recorded and later uploaded onto LMS for access by those students who were not able to attend the live class/facing problem in live classes or for who want to follow-up. There is a 15-minute question answer session at the end of each session As all the prerequisites, as communicated by HEC, are fulfilled, online classes will be started from 1st June, 2020 for all Undergraduate, graduate and Post Graduate levels. **Faculty** Faculty are advised to carry out following activities in lieu of carrying online sessions: Each recorded lecture shall be uploaded on the LMS for review and other purposes. Faculty members shall upload their full schedule of courses at the LMS to help students in taking appropriate class. Faculty members shall upload course before the classes by virtue students’ will able to prepare themselves for classes.

**Course Drop facility** SMIU being a public sector University, has been proudly imparting quality education to all its students without any discrimination on the basis of religion, gender, cast or social status. The fact that cannot be overlooked is that many of its students might not have access to proper equipment (Laptop, PC or cellphone) along with the absence of suitable internet connection to join online classes. Hence, the Honorable Vice Chancellor has approved purchase and distribution of internet dongles and Bundles, among the needy students. To provide equal learning opportunities to all students, it is proposed that students who are unable to join online classes may be provided with option to drop the course/semester and take enroll in any subsequent semester in accordance with university policies. To further ensure that the graduation period may not be increased, these students are allowed to take **up to 7 -** **8** courses for undergraduate,**up to 5-6** courses for Graduate studentsin the subsequent semesters. Survey conducted by Department of Students Affairs, is used to estimate the number of students who are unable to join online classes / required internet bundle due to different limitations, as student from outside Karachi and also few from within Karachi not have access to appropriate technological support to avail this opportunity.

## SMIU organises panel discussion on “Role of Industries in Academic Sector, Conference for Youth 7.0” 
September 26, 2024
[ ![degrees](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/26-sept.jpg)](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/26-sept.jpg>)
The academicians and industrialists have stressed upon the need to work together for strengthening cooperation in private and public sector of the county that is needed for development of Pakistan. They suggested that the academia must share their research work with industries and also include Industry Semester to their syllabus of final year, that is why students could get six-month internship from industries. This was stated at a panel discussion organised by the ORIC and Business Incubation Center of SMIU with collaboration of the Entrepreneurs Den on the subject of “Role of Industries in Academic Sector, Conference for Youth 7.0” at Sindh Madressatul Islam University on Thursday, September 26, 2024. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, Vice Chancellor of SMIU said the public sector universities of the country are doing very well. Research scholars of the universities are also contributing greatly towards the development of the country; hence the industrial sector should get benefit from these researches. The vice chancellor said we are producing not only good graduates but responsible youth, therefore their participation in the industries would be valuable for industries as well as for the country. Dr. Sahrai further said universities are receiving about 80 percent students from public sector schools and colleges. In addition to it, he said despite limited resources the universities are producing good results. “SMIU will prefer to establish collaboration with the industries of the country,” the vice chancellor said and added that along with Karachi the industrialists must extend their cooperation to the universities working in Karachi, Dadu, Sukkur, Khairpur, Hyderabad, Larkana, Mianwali, Khuzdar and other cities of all provinces of the country. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai thanked the guests who participated in the discussion. He also praised the efforts of SMIU’s Director ORIC Dr. Mansoor Ahmed Khuhro, Assistant Professors Ms. Quratulain Nazir, Mr. Shahid Obaid and others for organising the successful event. 
Mr. Hamza Y. Tabbani, Chairman Tabbani Group of Industries said we are 50 years behind the developed world and Artificial Intelligence is dominating on all fields of life, hence we all have to play our due role in the country. 
He further said today’s students are enjoying latest facilities to enhance their knowledge and experience, but they should not waste their time on social media and other such activities. He was of the view that we are facing price hike at large, therefor in such conditions single bread earner could not bear all expenses of a family, hence each and every person has to contribute to the family and to the country as well. 
Mr. Bilal Talib, CEO California Real Estate and Builder said we have to move ahead by accepting challenges. He said the success through any lottery is not sustainable, experiences of life and training play a key role in individual’s success. Therefore, the young generation must believe in continuous struggle and consistency in their efforts. He suggested that the young generation must set their goals and targets of life. 
Senator Abdul Haseeb Khan, Chairman Brooks Pharmaceutical said in today’s world the young people should not look towards public sector jobs, but they should move towards the entrepreneurship. Sharing his experiences in the field business the 85 years old Senator Haseeb Khan said that he had started a small business in the age of 12 years, now about 2000 workers are related with his business. He advised the students to take initiative in their young age and will succeed with the passage of time. 
Mr. M Aman Pir, member of Advisory Board of America Pakistan Business Development Forum said in the present day challenging world education has an important relationship with the industry, therefore they must collaborate with each other. 
Dr. Jamshed Adil Halepoto, Dean Faculty of Management, Business Administration and Commerce at SMIU said that we have not created business culture in the country yet, that is why majority of youth is preferring to the public sector jobs, but youth must understand the reality that they may earn more through business rather than any job and that act will also bring a qualitative change in the society. 
Earlier, Director ORIC Dr. Mansoor Ahmed Khuhro in his welcome address thanked the guests and said that the collaboration between universities and industries is key to innovation, entrepreneurship, and preparing students for the real world. At ORIC, we are committed to building strong connections between academia and industry, ensuring that our research and learning directly benefit society. Mr. Babar Saleem, Mr. Rehan and Ms. Saima Siddique also shared their views. 
On this occasion Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai gave away souvenirs to the guests, while Mr. Bilal Talib presented shields to SMIU’s Dean Dr. Zahid Ali Channar, Dr. Jamshed Adil Halepoto, Mr. Shahid Obaid, Assistant Professor, Mr. Muhammad Naeem Ahmed, Assistant Professor, Mr. Poorab Sarhan, Lecturer, Mr. Muhammad Danish Mujtaba, Lecture, Muzafar Ali Shah, Lecture, Mr. Shafiq Ahmed, Lecturer, Syed Bilal Ahmed and Anwar Ali Abro.

His remarks focused on how initiatives like the PRB are essential in confronting global environmental challenges. He said that the PRB marks a crucial step forward in the collective fight against plastic waste and setting a precedent for future sustainability projects. Dr. Sahrai said today the entire world is facing a great threat of environmental degradation, therefore we all have collectively work to make the world environmentally sustainable and free from any threat.
Dr. Hina Shehnaz, Chairperson of the Department of Environmental Sciences at SMIU said that the PRB not only provides monetary rewards but also fosters a strong culture of environmental stewardship. She said that by aligning with WWF, a global leader in conservation, this initiative is expected to make a significant impact, both locally and internationally. 
Ms. Nazifa Butt, Director of Climate Action and Sustainability at WWF, along with Usama Hussain, Regional Senior Sustainability and Circularity Officer, and Sahib Alam Khan, Senior Officer for Circularity and Sustainability, provided valuable insights on how the PRB aligns with WWF’s broader climate action strategies and sustainability goals. They emphasized that the PRB has the potential to revolutionize Pakistan’s waste management practices and accelerate the transition to a circular economy.
They said that the core objective of this initiative is to promote the circular economy, with a particular focus on plastic circularity. It will target the collection and recycling of PET plastics, multi-layer plastics, and used beverage cartons by fostering collaboration between key stakeholders in these sectors. The speakers were of the view that through this kind of efforts, WWF aims to align with its global mission of addressing the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, creating a positive and far-reaching impact on both the environment and the economy.

## Sindh Madressatul Islam University celebrates 140th Foundation Day of SMI 
September 2, 2024
[ ](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/September-2.jpg>)
Sindh Madressatul Islam University celebrated 140th Foundation Day of SMI with great enthusiasm and commitment. In this connection 3-Day Celebration activities were organised by the Directorate of Students’ Affairs and Counselling, from 1st September to 3rd September. 
A grand ceremony of SMI’s Foundation Day was held on Monday, September 2, 2024 at the Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium. Different groups of the students of SMIU Model School and SMI University performed on folk songs and delivered speeches on SMI’s historic role in modern education which it played during pre and post-independence period of Pakistan. A group of students led by a teacher Dr. Akbar Ali Chandio presented a poem on SMI. Messages of SMIU alumni who are studying abroad as well as those who are serving different organizations in the country were also played. A great tribute was paid to the founder of SMI Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi and distinguished alumnus of SMI and founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others. Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, Vice Chancellor of SMIU, students, deans and officers also participated in the cake cutting ceremony. Dr. Sahrai announced Rs.2000/- and Rs.3000/-for each student of SMIU Model School and SMI University, who performed during the Foundation Day, from his own pocket, not from SMIU. 
In his address at the ceremony Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai talked on the social and educational conditions of this region in the colonial period of British rule and highlighted enlightened thoughts, modern approach and tireless struggle of Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi for establishment of a modern school- Sindh Madressatul Islam in Karachi for Muslim children. 
He said the period under British rule was most difficult for Muslims. They were deprived of their fundamental rights and were kept at a distance from official responsibilities, benefits and privileges. That social injustice compelled Hassanally Effendi and his friends to bring a change in the community and in the society through establishing a modern institution that could educate their kids according to the demand of the day. “Hassanally Effendi was not a wealthy person, but he was belonging to a lower middle class family and had started his career as a clerk. He realized that establishing a modern education institution is the only way to restore dignity of the community and attain progress. 
Dr. Sahrai said there are three stages of SMI. Firstly, it was founded as a school on 1st September 1885, then it was upgraded to a level of college on 21st June 1943 and was inaugurated by Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the third stage was getting university status on February 16, 2012. “During this whole journey of success SMI has never forgotten its prime responsibility of providing modern and quality education to its younger generations. 
He said Sindh Madressatul Islam school is an integral part and asset of Sindh Madressatul Islam University that will be made more developed in coming days. 
“When I had assumed charge of vice chancellorship of SMIU some four years ago in August 2020, I was shocked to see the affairs of the SMI Model School which was being run from the budget of SMI university. It was not good omen for the school, because how much long the university could have sustained its expenditures, then I took efforts and received a separated budge of Rs90 million for the school from Government of Sindh. “Before him the SMI University was also being run in more than 60 percent of deficit. There was only 1800 enrollment, but now after four years SMIU is being run in surplus and there are more than 5500 students at SMIU. “In the next four years SMI University and SMIU Model School will be more developed,” the vice chancellor pledged and added that now our focus will be on the internationalization and ranking of SMIU. 
He was of the view that we must make our institutions sustainable because, these are pillars of the development of the country also. The Vice Chancellor said we must come out from conventional approaches and be committed because in the 21st century every second is very much important in the life, that couldn’t be wasted. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai further said at present although he is the senior most vice chancellor in Sindh province, but he considers himself a professor of the province, of the country and of the world as well. Likewise, all people must be loyal to their institutions, their province, their country and the world. He was of the opinion that we should not underestimate our younger people, they are tomorrows leaders, only our educational institutions should groom them in right direction. 
Earlier, Mr. Naeem Ahmed, Director of the Students Affairs and Counselling presented welcome address. Deans Dr. Jamshed Adil Halepoto and Dr. Zahid Ali Channar also spoke. The ceremony was attended by students, faculty, officers and other employees in a large number.

## Session on Special Children held 
June 6, 2024
[ ](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/6-june.jpg>)
The Department of Media and Communication Studies at SMIU organized an interactive session on “Children with Inclusive Needs” at the university’s auditorium on June 6, 2024. The session was presided over by Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, with noted philanthropist and Chairman of the Edhi Foundation, Mr. Faisal Edhi, serving as the chief guest. During the event, final-year students from the department presented video reports and short films on the daily lives, activities, and challenges faced by special persons as part of their final-year projects. 
In his address, Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai noted that special persons constitute about 16 percent (more than 1 billion) of the world’s population. He highlighted that there are 15 million special persons in Pakistan and stressed that society must treat them as valued individuals, ensuring that necessary facilities are provided in buildings and public transport. 
Dr. Sahrai emphasized that for the country’s development, all marginalized communities, including women and special persons, must be included in every field. He mentioned that Sindh Madressatul Islam University had incorporated facilities for special persons in its buildings being constructed on the Malir campus. 
Dr. Sahrai welcomed Mr. Faisal Edhi, the son of the distinguished philanthropist Mr. Abdul Sattar Edhi and chairman of the Edhi Foundation, to Sindh Madressatul Islam University. At the Vice Chancellor's suggestion, the audience gave a standing ovation to honor the great services of Abdul Sattar Edhi. Dr. Sahrai remarked, “There were few individuals in the world who had no controversy, and Mr. Abdul Sattar Edhi was one of them,” and he commended Mr. Faisal Edhi for continuing his father's noble mission. The Vice Chancellor offered his support for any future needs related to humanitarian service. 
Dr. Sahrai also praised the video reports prepared by the students of the Department of Media and Communication Studies, noting that they had fulfilled their social responsibility. 
In his address, Mr. Faisal Edhi stated that those special persons engaged in small businesses are the real heroes and deserve support. He emphasized that these individuals strive for a better life and wish to contribute to society, thus requiring our support. 
Mr. Edhi highlighted that Karachi had 2 million children enrolled in primary schools, while 2.6 million children were out of school. He called for efforts to provide education to all children in the country. 
He shared an anecdote about meeting a Palestinian diplomat in Islamabad a few years’ prior, requesting permission to start work for children in Gaza. The diplomat had responded that while Egypt could grant such permission, despite the war imposed by Israel at that time, Gaza had a literacy rate of over 98 percent and was operating three shifts of schools due to a shortage of buildings. Mr. Edhi argued that, given there is no war-like situation in Pakistan, efforts should be made to educate all children, and if necessary, schools should operate in multiple shifts like in Gaza. 
Mr. Edhi noted that there are currently no “nuns” in Karachi, who were mainly from Christian and Hindu communities. This lack of support affects many children’s homes in Karachi, such as Darulsukun. He also pointed out that decreased financial support from European countries due to their engagement in wars has created a crisis for welfare organizations. 
He stressed the need for a skilled Pakistan where both normal and special children receive vocational training. Mr. Edhi appreciated Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai and the students of the Department of Media and Communication Studies for organizing such an important session. 
Special persons including Saba Ghizali, Gold Medalist, PhD Scholar, and visiting faculty at SMIU; Syed Ali Hassan, Sub Editor of Monthly Qaumi Zaban, Anjuman-i-Taraqqi-i-Urdu; Preeti Varodra, receptionist at TDF Magnificence Centre; and Ali Khan Tareen, Co-CEO and Founder of Khas Foodz, shared their success stories. They suggested that the government should provide facilities in workplaces and public places for special persons. Savio M. Pereira, CEO of Darulsukun Welfare Society, also spoke about the needs and problems faced by special persons. At the end of the event, Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai presented shields to the guests.

The minister said although British did a good job in making Sindh a modern region but he, raising a question for historians said, he is still wonder that when British government established Bombay University, Kolkata University and Punjab University, then why they did not establish a university in Sindh? Adding to that Mr. Madad Ali Sindhi said in Sindh, at that time, Sindh Madressah, D.J. College, a college in Hyderabad, a college in Shikarpur and other schools and colleges were established by different communities privately. 
He said that our young generation must be informed about Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi’s services and of such personalities. “I have also an association with Sindh Madressah as my father had received his education from SMI in 1913,” the minister said and added that he feels proud to be here at this historic institution. 
He was of the view that we have forgotten Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi. Our scholars have ignored him too. He said the last abode of Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi in Hyderabad was in most deplorable condition, when he had last seen. “I am also member of the Heritage Committee of Sindh, thus we have included the resting place of Effendi in the heritage and I also have said to Sindh Culture Department to work for its preservation,” Madad Ali Sindhi said. 
Talking on standard of education in the country, the federal minister said that we have been lost the quality education on all levels, we must think on it.

The vice chancellor said almost all prominent persons one or other way have been linked with Sindh Madressah, because it is a pioneer modern Muslim institution of Sindh. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai further said we have upheld the legacy of Hassanally Effendy by developing SMIU as a modern university of the country. Highlighting the performance of SMIU he said three year ago there were only 1850 students at SMIU, now such figure has reached at 6000 students.

Senator Javed Jabbar in his speech said although Hassanally Effendi had become orphan in his childhood, but he acquired education not only in Arabic and Persian but he learned English language, because he had a vision and was witness of the British rule over here. He said Englishmen were arrogant and racist but Hassanally Effendi earned their confidence through his abilities. He said second half of the 19th century was difficult for Muslims of British India, and that conditions pushed Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and Hassanally Effendi to launch education movement in respective parts of the subcontinent. 
Madam Mahtab Akbar Rashdi said it was the first time that Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi is being remembered on a big level. She said Hassanally Effendi was a great visionary who was loving his land and its people.

She said the basic challenge is curriculum reforms and teaching community must change their mindset, as they still believe in outdated and old thoughts and practices. Dr. Anjum Bano of Iqra University Karachi said teachers and students are not aware about sustainable goals of education, hence students, teachers and community must be introduced with them.

He was of the view that whenever a ban or restrictions are imposed then our business community is changing their attitude and mode of working. Dr. Shujaat Mubarak, Dean CBM, IOBM said in our country manufacturing is not promoted. This is why, there is no sustainable manufacturing in Pakistan. He feared that in coming few years our textile industry will pass through more difficult days and its major parts have been shifted to Bangladesh.

He said food sector in our country is growing but there is an issue of quality food. Therefore, food companies must provide quality food to their customers. Dr. Jamshed Adil, Dean of SMIU said our businessmen are failed to adopt new technologies. Hence industry must accept challenges of the world. Mr. Naeem Ahmed Lecturer of SMIU was the moderator.

The Sindh Madressatul Islam University celebrated its 138th on Thursday, 1st September 2022 foundation day at the Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium, with simplicity due to the present day sorrowful conditions of people of the country created by torrential rains and flood. It was the first time in the history of SMIU that no cake cutting ceremony was held and not a singing session by students and other such jubilations were held on the occasion. While addressing the ceremony Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, Vice Chancellor SMIU said we are passing through hard times these days. Sindh and other provinces of the country have badly affected by heavy rains and floods, hence we all are worried for our countrymen. Thus, we are just remembering this historic day of SMIU’s life by organising a simple ceremony. The vice chancellor announced to donate his two days’ salary for rain and flood affected people and SMIU’s Endowment Fund respectively. The vice chancellor advised to SMIU employees to voluntarily donate for rain affected families, whatsoever they can. “If you donate one-day salary, half day salary, few hours or one-month salary, it’s up to you, but must support rain and flood victims,” the vice chancellor suggested. Paying rich tribute to the founder of SMI Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai said he was a real son of the soil and unsung hero of the land who established a modern educational institute for the nation as he was fully aware about the challenges the nation was facing in 19th century in the British colonial rule and had to face in coming days. “Unfortunately, a large number of our literate people are unware about the role and services of Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi,” he said and added that we must explore and share his great contribution towards modern education specially with our young generation to motivate them for the service of the country. Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai was of the view that when a child is born in a family, he/she brings a lot of happiness for them, but when an institution is built it brings happiness for a nation- and the institution can’t meet to a natural end like a human being but it can grow with the passage of time. He said we are custodian of SMIU, and its legacy, hence our sincere and honest efforts are needed for its progress and development. He opined that stable educational institutions are produced good results and good students, but the unstable institutions fail to serve the nation accordingly. Hence stability and strength of SMIU must be given priority. Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai said I have also a sentimental attachment with SMI as my father Mr. Taj Sahrai (who was a noted research scholar, historian and academician of Sindh) was its alumnus. He also lauded efforts of Director Directorate of Students Affairs and Counselling Dr. Asif Ali Wagan and his team for organising the event. Earlier, Dr. Asif Ali Wagan delivered welcome address and congratulated SMIU’s students, faculty and staff members on the SMIU’s foundation day and termed the SMIU a proud institution of the country.

He said currently we are living in a hazardous world, but younger generation should come forward and play their significant role in spreading awareness among masses including farmers about environmental issues. The Vice Chancellor said, in Sindh province Karachi city is more affected by the climate change. “Disasters come in seconds but recovering from the destruction takes years. Therefore, before meeting the disaster we must try to handle the issues seriously and consciously,” Dr Sahrai said. He advised the Department of Environment of Sindh Madressatul Islam University to form a waste management system in the campus, and work on the agenda that how can we keep clean and green to the university. Mr. Muhammad Umer Karim, water resources management specialist, who is working with UN-FAO talked on the environmental issues of Sindh with connection underground water issues. He said, in Sindh, river flow is decreasing due to increase in usage of underground water through tube wells on governmental as well as private level. “The natural flow of a river firstly maintains the underground water level, but it is causing low flow of water in the river,” he said. Mr. Umar Karim said we are producing good crops in Sindh, but rise in cash crops results in dried up of Indus River. He said before colonial era, there was a centuries old natural irrigation system in Sindh, which was environmental friendly. Looking back to his childhood, he said in his childhood days, people were getting sweet water by giving a cut to the land, but today about 80 to 85 percent water is saline. He said when the river is filled with water, then we are getting fresh underground water. “Indus River is our lifeline, but we had destroyed our environmental system by shortage of water,” he said and added that ground water availability in Sindh must be maintained up to 8 to 10-million-acre foot. Usage of more underground water will create geological problems too. Therefore, we should not over exploit underground water. He was of the view that floods and rains used to recharge a thin layer of aquifer, which used to be consumed throughout the year through hand pumps or dug Wells. The contiguous irrigation system raised the cropping intensities as well as ground water tables. Mr. Umer Karim further said the intensification of crops and further use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides has contaminated the resource base. We cannot directly use water for drinking purpose from any source place in the country. This is very deep environmental issue which needs proper research. He gave presentation on historical mapping of Ground Water in Sindh by M.H Panhwer, and Lower Indus Development Plan 1966. In last he encouraged the young students to adopt this topic for future research and diagnosis. Mr. Jibran Khalid Kidwai, environmentalist and social development consultant and alumni of SMI University, who is working on various national and international projects, emphasized that it is the time we should promote environmental education, inspire action, and renew and expand commitments to protect our planet, country and province. Mr. Jibran also updated the forum that Sindh will be leading province to launch first ever cleaner production policy by Sindh Environmental Protection Agency. He also said that specially in Sindh province there are very serious environmental issues including deforestation, urban and rural flooding, desertification and degradation of fresh water bodies. Later on, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University gave away shields to the guests. Incharge chairperson of the Department of Environmental Sciences Dr Imran Ali thanked the guests. 
The seminar was attended by Dean Faculty of Sciences Prof Dr Aftab Ahmed Shaikh, Director PGS Prof Zahid Ali Channar, Director ORIC Dr Amir Iqbal Umrani, Chairperson Departmental of Environmental Sciences Dr Imran Ali, Department Coordinator Mr. Abdul Majeed Pirzada, Faculty members and students.

National Agriculture Education Accreditation Council (NAEAC) chairperson, Prof. Dr. Ishtiaq A. Rajwana called upon higher education institutions to dedicate the 8th semester for full fledge internship. There should not be a short course, no parallel internship or classwork in the last semester. Ideally, internships should be paid and to find such internships should be the responsibility of the head of the departments and career placement officers. The universities that adopted this practice have had fruitful results.
He was addressing the 'NAEAC Quality Assurance and Accreditation Awareness Seminar' organized by the Department of Environmental Sciences, Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU).
While addressing the importance of curricula he said that the environmental sciences discipline might be on the radar of the National Curriculum Council of Pakistan in 2022. New and national curricula of Environmental sciences were going to emerge under academic pision.
He stated, “reputable organizations present themselves and ask the professional councils for third party evaluation voluntarily.” He said that before providing accreditation, they tried to organize awareness seminars, in which their experts guided the institutions so that they could complete the requirements to get accreditation.
“To prevent parents and students from any fraud we try to differentiate between legitimate and non-legitimate educational institutions so that children get rid of defaulter institutions,” said Dr. Rajwana.
The Vice chancellor, SMIU, Prof. Dr. Mujeebuddin Sahrai Memon concluded the seminar and said that usually people come and visit the institutions and concentrate on weaknesses and shortcomings but this time, he said, they received positive attitude.
“I felt quite comfortable while going through the parameters of accreditation council, and simultaneously, I was analyzing the university that fulfills the requirements,” said Dr. Sahrai, adding that he was hoping that in future visits of NAEAC they would do their best to receive W or X category.
He appreciated the inception of HEC and said the role and support of HEC shall be appreciated. Institutions like HEC were a blessing for us. If this institution did not exist, all the universities would be scattered.
On this occasion, Dr. Imran Chhajro, HoD of Environmental sciences gave a presentation on SMIU. Deans, Director ORIC, faculty, and students of the Department of Environmental Sciences were also present.

Speaking as the chief guest, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, also the chancellor of all public-sector universities in the province said that he has been attending convocations since the last three years and has observed how female students generally take all top positions. He said that this is to be seen whether girls are more intelligent than boys or do they take studies seriously and then why girls don’t pursue their careers in practical life. “This has become a dilemma of our society that as soon as girls get done with their education, they’re married off,” he said, adding that doing so all the hard work of girls, their struggles, and gold medals go in vain. 
The governor addressing the female students said that they should step out in the professional world and serve the nation as well. He said that students generally think that life after graduation is easy, “but let me tell your nothing is easy in life, you have to struggle.” 
The governor said that the federal government initiated Kamyab Nojawan Programme in Pakistan under which the youth will get an Rs50 carror load. “The students should bring in their ideas and achieve their dreams,” he said.

He said that all stakes of the university; those are faculty, officers, and supporting staff, need to have a strong chemistry to produce a wonderful graduate, to produce a groomed person, to produce a human being, and henceforth to produce a responsible global citizen. “It is this connection that I preached at 5th Asia-Europe Rectors’ Conference held at the Czech Republic in 2016 that in the 21st-century institutes shall receive the students as their customers and send-off them as quality products. I and my faculty are pretty confident today that the product which we are sending in the mainstream of this country and global stream of the world will serve with utmost responsibility, integrity, and honesty.” 
The SMIU, he said, carries the legacy of 137 years with credit of producing visionary leadership, educationists, sports champions, rather I shall say icons of any field and top of everything the founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. However, being a university, we are just nine years old starting with five programs, 129 students, and around 150 faculty and staff, he said adding that currently they are running 16 programs, having a student population of 4000 with 87 faulty of which 40% Ph.D. and 222 supporting staff.

[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/environment.jpg>)
KARACHI: The Department of Environmental Science of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) organized the one-day National Conference on Environment and Sustainable Development on Friday at the Senate Hall of the University. Vice Chancellor of the SMIU, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, said it is honour for us that a number of experts in environment science are present here. Environment is an extremely important subject and "we have to leave a legacy about solving environmental issues so that our children live in a safe place". He said the university would establish a state-of-the-art facility regarding the environmental science in the university's Malir Campus in addition to the existing department in the SMIU's city campus. We will establish an environmental laboratory equipped with modern facilities. He greeted the team for organizing a successful conference on a very important issue. Earlier Prof Imran Hashmi of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) spoke over the issues relating to water in Pakistan. About water availability, he said 5,260m3 were available with the country in 1951 which had decreased to 1,000m3 in 2016. Dr Hashmi said expected drop in the available water would be about 860m3 by 2025, marking our transition from a water stressed to a water scarce country About surface water; he said river flows were heavily dependent on glacial melt (41%), snowmelt (22%) and rainfall (27%). He added that 50 MAF of groundwater extracted from the aquifers and already crossed the sustainable limit of safe yield. "Water losses are estimated to be 46 MAF annually." [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/environment-smiu.jpg>)The seminar was informed that 84% of the population does not have access to safe drinking water. "Pakistan is among top ten countries with greatest number of people living without access to clean drinking water." Dr Atif Mustafa of the NED University of Engineering and Technology spoke over the nature-based solutions (NBS) to existing environmental problems. He said supporting economic development in urban areas alongside sustainable urban planning with NBS provided opportunities for adaptation to climate change thus increasing urban resilience to risks involving droughts, floods and heatwaves. He said constructed wetlands can be defined as engineered water saturated areas in which the natural removal processes for the water pollutants were reproduced and enhanced to optimize the purification performances. NBS for wastewater treatment in local context of Karachi, Dr. Mustafa said, the existing centralized wastewater treatment systems treated a fraction of total wastewater generated while further expansion of existing wastewater treatment plants was practically impossible because of no availability of land. He said NBS can successfully remove pollutants from domestic and industrial wastewaters in the environmental setting of Karachi. They can be applied as a sustainable, low cost and low energy technology for solving the wastewater treatment problem with added multiple benefits. Dr Samiuzzaman of Global Environmental Lab spoke over various problems conflicting Karachi. He said continuous increase in population due to urbanization, concentration of Industries, lack of civic facilities and treatment plants for industrial and domestic wastes and lack of implementation of environmental laws posed serious hazards to the country's largest city. "There is a continuous migration from other areas to Karachi. Town planning is not possible due to continuous increase in population, thus all the resources are under heavy stress, and lack of responsibility in civic agencies." Prof Tasneem Gul Kazi of University of Sindh, said Tharparkar was one of the most food-insecure regions in Pakistan. "The groundwater that people consume is saline to brackish, and has a high concentration of various salts and minerals, which are dangerous for human, as well as livestock health." She said around 454 children had died in Thar in 2018, while 450 children died in the region in 2017; 479 in 2016 and 398 children lost their lives in 2015. "Stable underground water is lacking in understudy areas, however, a number of brackish to saline open dug wells having depth 15–160 ft, used for drinking and livestock purposes." Shahid Amjad of the Institute of Business Management, Karachi, gave presentation about four coastal locations of the city - Ibrahim Hyderi, Reheri (Khalifa Jat Paro), Lat Basti and Chashma Goth. He said respondents to a survey conveyed that the mangrove wood selling business had been severely affected due to the availability of gas (cheaper option) which had replaced mangrove wood as a fuel. After supply of natural gas, mangrove wood was no more a primary source of fuel in the four villages, yet, still used if gas pressure was low. The total value of fuel wood consumption per year in these four locations is estimated Rs274 million. Earlier in the inaugural session of the conference, Dean, Faculty of Information Technology of SMUI Prof. Dr. Syed Asif Ali, Dean faculty of Information Technology in his opening address thanked the research scholars, who attended the conference. He said that this conference provides an opportunity to the research scholars and environmentalists to rethink on the environmental issues facing the country and the world. He also said that this conference will help to find solutions of the environmental problems. Incharge Chairperson of the Department of Environmental Science Dr Mohammad Hashim Zubairi in his welcome remarks said that when nature is left alone, it has a tremendous ability to care for itself. However, when man enters the picture and uses many of the natural resources provided the environment, things change. He hoped that the conference will be productive for the country. Prof. Dr. Aliya Rehman of Department of Botany, University of Karachi in her presentation on Red Seaweeds of Karachi coast, stressed upon that it is the fundamental responsibility of academia to aware young generation about hazardous of environmental degradation. She was of the view the seaweeds can be alternative food source in the country and these can be used for making cosmetic products but we are still unaware about the proper usage of seaweeds. She said in Pakistan there is no one ready to invest in this field, which is a multi-billion dollar business in other countries. She also talked on the environmental implications of polythene bags and suggested that alternative of these bags should be find out. Other prominent environmental experts and academicians also spoke.

The Vice Chancellor said in America, women struggled for about one century to get right of vote and right of property. Likewise, in Sindh, there were only three Muslim male graduates in 1885. Therefore, Sindh Madressatul Islam was established to provide modern education to Muslims of this regions. Once this one portion of the society, that was comprised of male, got modern education, then they started to provide same education to their women. "All things are getting change through evolution. Hence, all segments of the society will get equal rights through the process of evolution," He said.

Referring participation of women in literature and politics, she said that there are big names of women who have contributed a lot in the field of literature. Some of them were Quratulain Ain Hyder, Ismat Chughtai, Fahmida Riaz, Zahida Hina, Fatima Hassan, Azra Abbas and others.

Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) has said that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's character was his great legacy and he was a symbol of honesty. Therefore, each and every citizen of Pakistan must be honest and committed to the country and the nation. Delivering a memorial lecture on the subject of "Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and his legacy," in connection with the birthday anniversary of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah at the auditorium of SMIU on Monday, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had held higher positions in his life, but it was his honesty that no could dare to raise a figure towards his character. The Father of the Nation had himself called 'curse` to bribery and corruption in the undivided India and had said that it would be no space in Pakistan. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had wanted to see his country free from bribery and corruption at aimed to see the down trodden and poor masses of Pakistan prosperous and developed. But in the last seventy years we have failed to act upon his ideals. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Quaid-e-Azam-day.jpg>)Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh further said that competency was also another legacy of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. "Despite getting education from Sindh Madressatul Islam, which was established for downtrodden and poor pupils of Sindh, Mr. Jinnah succeeded to pass entrance test in Lincoln's Inn, London and then became a successful barrister in undivided India," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, a biographer of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah said and added that it was his competency that he became a great leader of Muslims of sub-continent and succeeded to get independence for his Country-Pakistan. "Youth of the country specially students of SMIU have a great responsibility to learn lessons from the life, struggle and ideology of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and like him, firstly they have to get education, financial independence and social status, then if they want, can enter in the politics for betterment of the country," the Vice Chancellor of SMIU said. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that on the occasion of birthday anniversary of the Father of the Nation we have to revisit life, struggle, achievements and ideals of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, after that our nation could move in right direction.
## SMIU's weeklong Festival of Arts and Ideas concludes
Karachi, December 15, 2018
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/weeklong.jpg>)
The annual Festival of Arts and Ideas organized by Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) on Saturday concluded after weeklong activities, which included 40 sessions on various subjects and issues, screening of documentaries and classical films and quiz competitions in which students actively participated. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor, SMIU, appreciated various committees comprising students and faculty which organized the weeklong event successfully. He also thanked the guests who arrived at the event from various parts of the country and from foreign territories. He said SMIU had pioneered the tradition to enhance the leadership qualities of students through various innovative means and that festival was part of the same scheme. He said the event provided platform to students to expose their talents in various forms that would boost their confidence and help them improve on that in future. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/weeklong-mashaikh.jpg>)He said the annual Festival of Arts and Ideas would resume next year as well. Speaking at the distinguished lecture series, Ameena Saiyid, a former managing director of Oxford University Press-Pakistan, appreciated the SMIU for organizing an inspiring event, adding, such events should be held in every university in the country. She congratulated the SMIU vice chancellor for spearheading a successful programme, which would provide a wonderful opportunity to students to expose their inner capabilities and bring young people close to literature and books. Ameena Saiyid in her thought provoking speech said that women in Pakistan were making a niche of their own in the country's male-dominated business establishments and it was just a beginning. She said Pakistani women were trying to create a passageway for those waiting in the wings. Ms Saiyid said she was not a feminist but had been working with men for decades and had encountered male prejudice, which took various forms. She added the reason for that was putting down a woman who equated herself with men professionally and to portray her as a person with a handicap or disability. She added, however, similar statements had also emanated from women. Ms Saiyid said the empowerment of women in Pakistan had trodded a painful course with every small victory snatched with the utmost exertion from the teeth of hardened prejudices. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/mashaikh-wife.jpg>)"Working women here are still pioneers in the early stages of their pilgrimage because the internal inequalities of power, authority, and resource allocation still remain in many families." She said unlike men, most women were trained to be managers from a very young age. "Think of housewives. What are they if not managers? They manage an intricate unit like a household with its human and material aspects; they manage family politics and devise strategies for stretching what is usually a limited income, and take care of countless household and family needs." She said housewives also managed siblings from early childhood, deal with the wrath of fathers and the recriminations of overworked mothers without running out to seek refuge in interesting occupations outside the home. "And yet their contribution is evaluated unfairly as being unproductive." She quoted Dr Mahbub ul Haq: "What a successful conspiracy to reduce women to economic nonentities." Ms Saiyid said women's attempts to redefine their identities had had success; the context invariably remained the family. "The family establishes the parameters and frames of reference. At the same time, it provides an anchor in a fast changing world." [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/festival-students.jpg>)She said women's strengths made them peculiarly suited for managerial positions and theirs should be a major presence in boardrooms. She spoke over building her own business in publishing and selling imported books before she joined OUP to head it 30 years ago. Prof Abdurrahman Tufan, a Turkish professor affiliated with school of medicine in Gazi University, Ankara, spoke in the distinguished lecture series in which he said modern day technology was helping the field of medicine in saving precious human lives. He said the use of drones should be enhanced in providing emergency treatment and supply of medicine particularly in the countries forming the Third World. A panel discussion on stereotypes for women was held in which Shaista Muhammad Ali, Dr Masuma Hasan and Dr Arfana Malahs poke over various issues conflicting women's empowerment in the country. A session on Shakespeare's poetic wisdom was held; while in another, students sang and indoor games were played.
## Mian Raza Rabbani addresses at the Festival of Arts and Ideas of SMIU
Karachi, December 14, 2018
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Mian-Raza-Rabbani.jpg>)
The Festival of Arts and Ideas, organized by Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) at its premises, entered in its fifth day on Friday in which various sessions were held in which experts and students spoke over various issues and ideas. Speaking at the distinguished lecture series, Mian Raza Rabbani, former Senate Chairman, thanked Sindh Madressatul Islam University's Vice Chancellor, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, for inviting him and applauded the university's endeavours to promote a culture of debate, which had long gone since the ban was imposed on student unions some decades ago. He said the ban on student unions divided students; thus, lack of academic freedom deprived them of the gift of critical thinking. He said that the Senate had passed a resolution demanding lifting of ban on students union, but no action had been taken as per its recommendation. Giving a brief account of Pakistan's foreign policy to students Mr. Raza Rabbani criticized United States for continuously pressuring Pakistan to 'do more' despite the country had suffered grave losses in terms of human casualties and properties on behalf of America in the Afghan war. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Festival-mashaikh.jpg>)He said Americans had never protected the interests of Pakistan; instead they had always been concerned about their own interests. "Once their interests are fully served, they show no qualms in leaving us in the lurch," said Mr. Rabbani. He said Pakistan itself suffered the deadly culture of drug and Kalashnikov in the wake of Afghan war. However, once the Americans got their task accomplished, they never came to rescue Pakistan from those menaces. He said United States wanted to make India as the policeman of the region because it considered India as its strategic partner; however, such American design was not acceptable to Pakistan. He said Pakistan was a sovereign country and would accept anything that was agreed upon on equal terms. Mian Raza Rabbani said the mindset of Indian establishment was rigid and narrow, as it had sabotaged every good thing that had been offered by Pakistan. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/festival-staff-faculty.jpg>)He referred to recent opening of Kartarpur route, which was a good gesture offered by Pakistan, yet, Indian foreign minister refused to attend the ceremony. He said India was involved in state-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere in Pakistan. He added that the worst violations of human rights were being committed in Indian-occupied Kashmir where all international laws and norms were being broken up and the rest of the world was silent. He asked where was the conscience of the West on those violations in Kashmir where children, women and men were being killed and exposed to pellet guns. He said Muslims in India were being attacked and killed on the pretext of eating beef. He criticized United States for putting Pakistan in the blacklist of religious freedom. He also academics and students should be involved for devising the country's foreign policy. Earlier, SMIU vice chancellor Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh introduced the speaker, adding, Mr Rabbani has always struggle for rights of people of Pakistan. He said that his association with SMIU is strengthened because his father was a close associate of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Quaid was also an old student of this institution. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/festival-school.jpg>)He also presented shield to the guest speaker afterwards. Prof Zeliha Kocak Tufan, a member of Turkish Council of Higher Education, spoke in the international lecture series in which she spoke over the issues relating to higher education of her country. She said a total of 206 institutions offering higher education in which 140,000 students from various countries were admitted; most of them were enrolled with universities in Ankara and Istanbul. They included 1,822 students from Pakistan. She referred to an exchange programme under which 256 students and 171 faculty members were affiliated with Turkish universities. Prof Tufan said students from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Germany, Somalia, Bulgaria, Egypt and Syria were studying in Turkish; adding, her country eagerly wanted wider cooperation with Pakistan in education sector. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/festival-school-students.jpg>)A panel discussion was held on leadership strategies for Pakistani business. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that Pakistan and Turkey have close friendly relations that are being strengthening day by day. He said SMIU has also a close association with Turkey, because Sultan of Turkey has given title of `Effendi` to Hassanally, founder of SMI. An impressive school show was organized in the premises; author Muhammad Ibrahim Joyo's life was discussed; and students presented the poetry of Sufi poet Mawlana Jalaoddin Rumi and Allama Muhammad Iqbal.

## Fourth Day of SMIU's Festival of Arts and Ideas
Karachi, December 13, 2018
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Fourth-Day.jpg>)
The Festival of Arts and Ideas, organized by Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) at its premises, entered in its fourth day on Thursday in which various sessions were held in which experts and students spoke over various issues and ideas. At a session "Media and the state: Is honeymoon over?" speakers blamed the electronic media for negative reporting because of racing for ratings that eventually painted negative image of the country elsewhere. Speakers, however, said despite being influenced by the highly divisive society of the country, Pakistani media still managed to play its positive role in trying disseminating untwisted information to people. They said a country of 200 million people was divided on various fronts; as there were people who supported fundamentalism and others sided with liberal and progressive ideas, yet, media outlets in general were ensuring that truthful information reached to people. They, however, blamed the race for ratings often forced the electronic media to run twisted and incorrect news items and twisted information on primetime talk shows. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Fourth-Day-smiu.jpg>)"Fundamentalism has gripped the country on the one hand and on the other there are liberal forces. Similarly, our society is divided on ideological grounds as well. In such a situation, media is still making it possible to inform people honestly," said eminent journalist Ghazi Salahuddin. He said such a role of the media was a part of the concerted effort to get the people glued to democratic process. Ghazi Salahuddin further said media was mirror to revolutionary changes in the world. He advised the students to broaden their vision and ability to conform with the changing scenario of the media business. Media personality Wusatullah Khan said media was not just limited to a newspaper or a news channel, but books, poetry, fiction, cinema and drama also fall in its vast definition. He said freedom of expression was attained through great struggles in the world. The freedom of expression was begotten a century ago in the West, which even increased after the World War-II. Wusatullah Khan spoke over the current financial crisis as being claimed by the media outlets. He said the media organisations got merely a quarter of its advertisements from the government while the rest of 75 per cent came from the private sector. Besides, he added, the media owners also had other businesses to earn from; in such a situation, he wondered, the financial problems being claimed by the media organisations was beyond comprehension and absurd. He said the character of media was also changing because it had to entertain the dictation of the clients who paid for advertisements. Journalist Mazhar Abbas said most talk shows on news channels were negative in nature and ratings were the key culprit to blame for it. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Fourth-Day-smiu-students.jpg>)He said most wrong information was being relayed on electronic media because of continuous pressure of deadlines and wild goose race for ratings; and they could not rectified later on. "Our reporting is highly irresponsible and this is leading the society to negative path." He said the electronic media's reckless reporting painted the negative image of Karachi elsewhere in the country and abroad; that even stopped foreigners in visiting the city on bizarre misconceptions. Owais Zaidi of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority said people were gradually getting aware about what was happening in the country and elsewhere in the world. He said the situation relating to media was not worse and it would take time for the business to get improved. Later, SMIU's Vice Chancellor Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh presented shields to the guest speakers. Meanwhile, quiz and poetry competitions among the students were held. Students presented the poetry of Sufi poet Sachal Sarmast. Separately, Madiha Rehman reviewed the works of novelist Kamila Shamsie in 'Life of an Author' session.

KARACHI: Accompanying scholars and delegates from abroad and across Pakistan, Vice Chancellor of the Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh on Wednesday formally inaugurated the second edition of the varsity's annual Festival of Arts and Ideas. National and international delegates, deans, faculty and senior management of SMIU were there to witness the festival. The vice chancellor visited the stalls set up by SMIU's students on the theme of "World is Our Home." All the stalls were depicting various cultures of the continents and nations of the world. Addressing the inaugural ceremony at the inner courtyard of the main building of the university, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that the theme of last year's festival was "Celebrating 70 Years of Pakistan," and this year's theme "World is Our Home" was selected as Pakistan was also a part of the world, thus, all the people living on the planet formed a single entity. He said many issues were common among the people living across the borders like poverty, world peace and climate change. Dr Shaikh said that world peace could bring prosperity and development in all parts of the world. He was of the view that the biggest bond among all people of the world was humanity. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/panel-discussion1.jpg>)"Today, with the help of information technology people living on the globe are coming closer to each other." However, he added, it was wrong that the times of wars had gone. "Wars are being waged in various countries and we, the human beings, have to go a long way to attain peace and tranquility in the world." Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh said that it was the need of the hour for humanity to sit together and settle down disputes. He appreciated efforts of coordination committee of the festival, office bearers of student societies, directorate of students' affairs, faculty and management of the university on organising successful festival. Justice (Retd) Agha Rafique Ahmed Khan said that the SMIU had organized a mega event which had benefited its students in all respects.

He highlighted SMIU's leadership programme and said the programme also provided opportunities to its students to visit national and international institutions. Prof Aleksei Bykov, a professor of international journalism associated with the St. Petersburg University, Russia, spoke at length over the 'Lesson on freedom of speech in the international journalism'. He referred to the World Press Freedom Index 2018 of the Reporters Without Borders where Pakistan had a better standing (139th in the list of 180 countries with last the least free) than Russia (148th) and China (176th). [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/lectures03.jpg>)The Russian professor also spoke over the conditions of the press freedom in his native country; he briefly referred to the happenings in Turkey particularly after the 2016 botched military coup. Speaking at the Distinguished Lecture Series programme, Junaid Ismail Makda, president of Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) said that Pakistan had started proceeding towards positive direction after peace had been restored after many decades. He said Pakistan was still the safest place on the planet. A panel discussion was held on the subject of "Education as an Instrument of Social Change". Noted educationists Dr. Mohammad Memon, Prem Sagar, Asif Ikram, Chandni Kumari were among the panelists. The discussants were of the view that during the past couple of decades, education had deteriorated badly as a result, "we have failed to bring social change". [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/lectures02.jpg>)They said at present the country was left with infrastructure and not the institutions. They added there was a dearth of pedagogical leaders and, sadly, teachers had turned into instructors only. Besides, the participants said syllabus being taught to students did not meet the modern day demands. "We need to revisit the whole scenario," said Dr Memon. Another panel discussion was held on "Impacts of Climate Change on Water Resources". Ahmer Bilal Soofi, Tania Saleem, and Naeem A. Mughal were among the panelists. In the series of "Life of an Author" the lifetime and poetry of Mirza Ghalib was reviewed by Dr Tanzeemul Firdous of the University of Karachi.

The second convocation of the Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) was held at the Convention Centre of the Golf Club, DHA, in which 271 students in five disciplines were conferred with bachelors and masters degrees.

Governor Imran Ismail said he felt it honour for him to be present at the convocation of an educational institution where Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had received his early education and where the father of the nation spent most of his academic life's years.
"No other educational institution could be more prestigious than the Sindh Madressatul Islam University where my leader, the founrder of Pakistan, had been enrolled with," said the Governor of Sindh.
He advised the students who had completed their education at the SMIU to chase their dreams as they liked, but those dreams should not be dreamed without Pakistan.
He said the country had produced great brains, yet, a dominant majority of them would migrate to other countries at the expense of the country's loss.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Convocation_02.jpg>)
"Pakistan deserves to offer success stories to the world, which we have not been able to do over the years for one reason or another. But, you should come forward and become inspiration for the generations to follow," said Governor Mr. Imran Ismail.
He said the outgoing students owed a lot to the country and it was the payback time.
He said loving and contributing better things to the country was part of the partnership every citizen had with one's motherland. He added the students should enter into various fields including economy, politics and arts etc. and set examples for the world.
He invited the students to visit the Governor House and witness the Quaid-e-Azam's office which had been preserved and offered the Quaid's life to look at. Besides, he also advised the women development minister to help those students visiting the Sindh Assembly.

He said the governor was keen to play his role in higher education in the province.
Narrating the historical significance of the SMIU, Dr. Shaikh said Sindh Madressatul Islam University was the second school founded by Hassanally Effendi in 1885 to impart Muslims with modern education a decade after Aligarh School.
He said the Sindh Madressatul Islam upgraded to the status of college by the Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah himself and was made a university in 2012 as per aspiration of the founder of the nation.
He said Quaid-e-Azam had so much love with the Sindh Madressatul that he bequeathed it a third of his property.
Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh said SMIU was the most qualitative and disciplined university among the public sector universities in Sindh. He spoke over the university's Leadership Programme under which students were exposed to top functionaries in Islamabad and four other countries like China, United Kingdom, Malaysia and Turkey.
He said 90 per cent of the first batch of the university which passed out last year had already got jobs. Similarly, a large number of students who had passed out this year had got job offers.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Convocation_04.jpg>)

## SMIU organizes a session with educationists on formation of School Education Commission in Sindh
Karachi, November 7, 2018
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/DSC_2300.jpg>)
The educationists of Sindh have supported the idea of forming School Education Commission (SEC) in Sindh to re-arrange and bring basic reforms in education system of the province, which is suffering from many problems including governance and administrative problems due to fragmentation and inconsistency prevailing in the Department of Education.
Sindh Madressatul Islam University's four member committee of research scholars have developed the said idea, in which they have suggested the Sindh Government to form SEC in Sindh on the pattern of Higher Education Commission that will look after the school education from pre-primary to intermediate level with the support of seven wings. The commission will be headed by a chairman, and that post must be tenure based.
While giving briefing to the academicians on the subject of "Reforming Education-Rethinking Governance" on Wednesday at the Senate Hall of SMIU, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University, who is also head of above mentioned committee, comprised of Dr Stephen John, Dr Muneer Moosa Sadruddin and Dr Rakhshanda Kokab said that the main task of SEC would be to improve education in Sindh from primary to intermediate level and all examination boards, Sindh Text Book Board, curriculum development bureaus, and other relevant bodies should be given under it.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/DSC_2305.jpg>)
He further said that at present affairs of education in the province are looked after by Government of Sindh's three separate departments and each department has its own secretary. "School education, college education and universities and boards are being looked after by three respective secretaries, and are assisted by other officers of general cadre," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said and added that due to the frequent transfers of these officers, they are failed to acquire in-depth knowledge of education sector and ensure delivery.
He was of the view that the fragmented structure and inconsistency in the department of education in the province, the curriculum development, textbook publications, examination boards, teachers' appointments, their training etc., are carried out by different bodies and organizations without any cohesion and coordination.
He further said that the commission would establish its seven wings such as curriculum development and textbook publication wing, examination and evaluation wing, infrastructural and physical facilities wing, enrollment enhancement wing and monitoring and evaluation wing (this would be responsible for ranking of school in star system), selection, capacity building and training wing, and private, non-formal and Madressah education wing.
He also proposed that the management of schools could be entrusted to the local governments on low level. In this regard schools from class one to class eighth should be given under the administrative control of union councils and from class ninth to intermediate should be given under district councils, while the commission will function as facilitator in vital areas of education including monitoring and evaluation of the institutions.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that this whole new management system will benefit all students especially poor children of the province because in Sindh about 52 percent students are out of school, which is a highest ratio than Punjab and KPK.
He was of the view that in the past Sindh's education system was considered best after Bengal, but today is not producing good results. Therefore, it needs improvement. "Quality education is must for development of any nation," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said and added we have to bring basic changes in the education system without any delay.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh also said that this is the third consultative session with educationists. Earlier, they have been held a sessions with Sindh Education Minister and officials of the Sindh Education Department and media persons.
A large number of educationists including Mr. Qamar Shahid Siddiqui of Provincial Institute of Teachers Education, Nawabshah, Dr. Farida Lodhi, Dr. Syed Abdul Aziz of Department of Education, Jinnah University for Women, Dr. Farhat Khanum, Dr. Kamal Hyder, Department of Education, Federal Urdu University, Karachi, Dr. Safia Urroj, Head of Department Teachers Education and Dr. Anjum Bano Kazmi, University of Karachi attended the session. They all fully supported reforms in education system, which were suggested by Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh in his presentation.

## Sindhi translation of the book "Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Education, Struggle and Achievement" launched
14 October 2018
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Sindhi-translation.jpg>)
Prominent intellectuals and academicians have said that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was the greatest Muslim leader of 20th Century. He was not a traditional landlord, Sardar and a religious leader, but he had come out from a middle class family and led the nation for independence with a power of arguments. They said this while addressing the inaugural ceremony of Sindhi translation of Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh's book titled "Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Education, Struggle and Achievement," which was held at the inner courtyard of Sindh Madressatul Islam University on Saturday night. The book was translated by Anwer Abro into Sindhi. It has also been translated into Urdu by noted journalist Rashid Butt. The speakers said that it was the only example in the history that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah got independence for the Nation through a legal way, polite politics and a power of arguments. The Sindh Minister for Education, Culture, Tourism & Antiquities, Syed Sardar Ali Shah said that from Kashmir to Kalibangan, it all area was the Indus Valley Civilization, and the village of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's ancestors was near to Kalibangan, which is now in present day Rajasthan. Hence, it is not a matter of any debate that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was born either in Jhirrak or in Karachi city, but we own him as our great leader and we have to make Pakistan as he had dreamt. Syed Sardar Ali Shah said that it is a matter of pride for him that he is talking on Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah at his Alma-Mater. "Sindh Madressatul Islam has remained a center of knowledge, a place of intellect and it has contributed a lot in the fields of education, politics, social science, literature and other areas of the country," the provincial minister said. He was of the view that we can make a new Pakistan only by implementing the ideology of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. "The Quaid's dream of independent, prosperous and peaceful Pakistan will come true when we will act upon the constitution," the minister said. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Education-mins.jpg>)The author Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that he has written this book specially for young people of the country, as they are mostly unaware about the real life, struggle and achievements of founder of Pakistan Quai-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. He further said that he preferred to make the book pictorial as in the digital era young people doesn't bother to read big books. Extending his offer to Sindh Education Minister for printing text books from SMIU Press, he said that SMIU Press will print text books of the Sindh government without getting any profit from it. He also suggested the names of Dr Suleman Shaikh, Dr Jaffar Ahmed and Prof. Saleem Memon for the board of publication of SMIU, who may suggest most valuable books for publication. Dr Jaffar Ahmed, prominent intellectual said that this book should be translated into other languages of Pakistan including Punjabi, Pashtu, Balochi, Seriaki etc. "This is a basic book on Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, therefore, the youth of the country must read it," he said. Dr Jaffar Ahmed praised the contribution of Dr Shaikh towards the history of Pakistan by writing this book. Dr Suleman Shaikh, Secretary of SZABIST said that this is a brief but comprehensive account of the life of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. He said that the author has cleared many ambiguities that were especially in the minds of young people about the life and struggle of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He disparately said that we have not acted upon Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Jinnah's thoughts that he had expressed about Pakistan in his famous speech of 11th August 1947, delivered in the Constitutional Assembly. Prof. Saleem Memon, Chairman of Shah Latif Chair of University of Karachi also lauded the work of Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh and said there is a need to write and get published this kind of books for younger generation. Earlier, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh gave a presentation to the Provincial Minister for Education Syed Sardar Shah and educationists about the formation of "School Education Commission" (SEC) in Sindh" on the lines of Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, at the Senate Hall of SMIU. In his presentation he said that the idea of formation of SEC is a brain child of five research scholars of SMIU, who want to improve the education system of the province from primary to intermediate level. Talking on the subject of "Reforming education and Re-thinking governance," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that today the Department of Education is fragmented and is facing inconsistency. He was of the view that the education system in Sindh has been collapsed due to the governance problems, as it has been divided into three parts, one is school education headed by a separate secretary, second is college education, which is also headed by another secretary and third is university education, which is too headed by another secretary. He suggested that a chairman should head the proposed School Education Commission, who should be PhD and have an ample experience in the sector of education. "Sindh Text Book Board, Curriculum Development, examinations boards and other such related departments should work under the SEC as its wings," Dr Shaikh said. Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah in his speech said that he himself had received his education from public sector educational institutions, therefore we all should get our children enrolled in public sector schools and colleges, that act will build trust on the public sector schools. He also said that there is a need of improvement and reforms in the education department of Sindh and they are working on it. Others also spoke on the book. The ceremony was attended by a large number of writers, intellectuals, academicians and students.

[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Research-Scholars.jpg>)
A four member committee of research scholars of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) headed by Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU has suggested to the provincial government of Sindh to formulate School Education Commission (SCE) on the pattern of Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan, to improve education from primary to intermediate level in Sindh and all the examination boards, Sindh Text Book Board, curriculum development bureaus, and other relevant bodies should be given under it. Addressing the 6th meeting of the Academic Council of SMIU, held at the Senate Hall of the university, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that at present school education is looked after by the Government of Sindh's two departments of school and college education. Both the departments are headed by secretary, assisted by other officers of general cadre, whose frequent transfers make it impossible for non-educationists to acquire in-depth knowledge of education sector and ensure delivery. He was of the view that due to such fragmented structure of education in the province the curriculum development, textbook publications, examination boards, teachers' appointments, their training etc., are carried out by different bodies and organizations without any cohesion and coordination. "The proposed commission should be headed by a chairman, who should be an educationist, preferably with a Ph.D., having vision and adequate experience in the field of education," the SMIU Vice Chancellor said and added that the commission may establish its some wings such as selection, capacity building and training wing, curriculum development and textbook publication wing, examination and evaluation wing, infrastructural and physical facilities wing, enrollment enhancement wing and monitoring and evaluation wing (this would be responsible for ranking of school in star system) and private and non-formal and madressah education wing. He said that these all wings of the commission would work under the chairman. The Think Tank of SMIU also proposed that the management of schools could be entrusted to the local governments, while the commission will function as facilitator in vital areas of education including monitoring and evaluation of the institutions. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that this whole new management system will benefit all students specially the poor children of the province because in Sindh about 52 percent students are out of school, which is a highest ratio than Punjab and KPK. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said so for nine education policies have been formed, but there is a need to implement only one education policy which was formulated by founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah in 1948. The Academic Council of SMIU supported the proposal of SMIU's Think Tank prepared for establishment of the School Education Commission in Sindh. The other members of the four members Committee of SMIU's research scholars, were Dr John Stephen, Dr Muneer Moosa and Dr Syeda Rakhshanda Kaukab. In the meeting the minutes of the 5th meeting of the Academic Council were approved and decisions were also taken regarding courses, research work and SMIU's education policy.

Sindh Madressatul Islam University celebrated 134th Foundation Day of the institution on Saturday in a befitting manner. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU, diplomates and other guests participated in the cake cutting ceremony, held at the Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium of the university. Afterwards, addressing the ceremony Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that establishment of Sindh Madressatul Islam on 1st September 1885 was a result of unrest prevailing in Sindh after annexation of Sindh by British in 1843 as Sindh's Muslims despite having six times more in the majority than other religious communities, were legged behind in all spheres of life. He added that failed war of Independence of 1857 had also compelled the Muslims of sub-continent to get modern education along with their religious education. "In this respect, the first successful experiment was done by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan by establishing Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875 at Aligarh," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said and added that after that successful experiment Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi with the support of Justice Amir Ali and with the advice of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, opened Sindh Madressatul Islam in Karachi in 1885.[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Foundation-Day-18-smiu.jpg>)He was of the view that in the later days SMI transformed Sindh's Society and produced great leaders of the nation. He said that today SMIU upholds its legacy and provides modern education especially to the students of under privileged class, because Sindh Madressah was established for poor students of the province. He said in the country there would be a few public sector universities out of two hundred public and private universities that would be imparting quality education to students, but SMIU is unique in its performance and policies as it provides highly modern education with all facilities to the students on lowest fees. "We also provide scholarships and fee concessions to the students," he said and maintained that SMIU gives 6000 rupees per month to poor students who couldn't afford even fare of transport. Dr Shaikh said that the most costly private universities are mostly producing elite class, which, in many cases used to leave the country and settled down in other countries, but lower middle class and middle people have to live over here in their own country and to serve it. This is why, SMIU gives quality education to the students of downtrodden class who will serve the country and bring positive change in it.[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Foundation-Day-18.jpg>)Earlier, Prof. Dr Zahid Ali Channar, Dean Faculty of Management, Business Administration and Commerce, Prof. Syed Asif Ali, Dean Faculty of Information Technology and students of SMIU highlighted role of the institute played in modern education as a school, college and university.

Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) has said that majority of senior researchers of the country are lacking fresh and innovative ideas related to the problems of the country. Also in majority universities of the country, research work and research skills are degraded. Therefore, we have to improve quality of research work and encourage young people, who are still uninitiated in research work. He said this while delivering a lecture to the faculty of SMIU on the subject of how to conduct a research and promote research culture in the country," at the Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium of SMIU. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh talked on research skills, methodology, methods, important components of research paper and other related topics in detail. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that in our country it has been observed that majority of senior faculty members are proved non-cooperative to juniors in research work feeling a fear that they could be replaced by them. On the country, he said, academia of developed countries are happily sharing their ideas and experiences with their juniors and also providing them necessary support which they are needed. Therefore, we have to change the non-cooperative culture in the field of research. Dr Shaikh said that there is an acute need to educate and support young academia about research work, who are lacking basic concept and importance of it. He advised young researchers that they, instead of depending on anyone else must take initiative by themselves believing in their own abilities. Prof. Dr Zahid Ali Channer, Dean, Faculty of Management, Business Administration and Commerce, Director ORIC Dr. Stephen John, Assistant Professor Munir Moosa Sadruddin, Director I.T Administration Mr. Shah Muhammad Butt and others gave presentations on the subject of research.

Addressing the meeting held to celebrate the day, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University said that exactly 75 years ago on this day, 21 June 1943, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah had inaugurated "Sindh Madressah College" elevating his Alma-Mater from school to college. He said that the Quaid had specially come from Bombay to Karachi for this occasion and was visibly observed sentimental during his speech delivered at the inaugural ceremony. "On that occasion the Quaid had also donated some amount for his Alma-e-Mater and had appealed to the audience that they must support SMI, because the institutions can't be run without financial support," Dr Shaikh said. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh further said that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had spent a longest period of his academic career at SMI ranging from 1887 to 1892. This is why, he had developed a deep association with his Alma-Mater, which, he had exhibited on various times including during writing his Last Will in 1939 in Bombay, where he had bequeathed one third of his residual property to SMI and after four years of it, he had come to SMI to upgrade it. In the last days of his life, the Quaid had also visited his Alma-Mater, because he seems very weak in a picture, which is preserved in the Jinnah Museum of SMIU. "Today the Alma-Mater of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah has become university, and is being considered as one of the modern and best quality universities of the country," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said added that today we proudly follow the legacy of founder of Pakistan by working on his ideals, because, without following his ideals, the country and the nation couldn't progress and move forward accordingly.

## Last day of SMIU's 2-Day International Conference
11 May 2018
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Last-day-Conference.jpg>)
American scholar Dr Wallace Ford, who is also Associate Professor and Chair of the Public Administration Department at Medgar Evers College, New York, USA, has said that a country with income and wealth disparities can never be a just country and a country with income and wealth disparities can be the source for political and social unrest that can produce more inequality and more injustice. He said this while delivering a keynote speech on the subject of "International Economic Development in the Modern Era: From Conquest and Colonialism to Empowerment and Inclusion," on Friday at second and last day of the 1st International Conference held on Management, Business and Leadership, and which was organized by Sindh Madressatul Islam University at a local hotel. Dr Wallace Ford said that no nation truly stands alone in the international marketplace - notwithstanding the senseless and ignorant statements by the American president whose name will not be spoken. Indeed, such great economic powers like China, the United States and the European Union have remained great through multiple economic alliances throughout the world. Dr Wallace Ford maintained that for the modern era to be truly modern, international economic development will need to be truly free and truly fair. Tracing the history of global economical powers he said that until the second half of the twentieth century, international economic was manifested in strategies that began with conquest and evolved into colonialism. From Alexander the Great to Genghis Khan - from Napoleon to Hitler - from the Mughal Emperor Akbar to Queen Elizabeth - from Shaka Zulu to Hannibal to Julius Caesar - international economic development was effected through conquest. He said there can be little argument that the ancient model of international economic development based upon conquest was the result of the desire to expand markets and to acquire resources to enhance the economy and national wealth of the nation that initiated the wars and consequent conquest. He was of the view that the destruction of the target nation, the decimation and enslavement of its people and the ancillary affect of eliminating the culture of that target nation were typically seen as the cost of doing business by the conquering nation. The American scholar further said that this unprecedented global conquest was accompanied by technological and scientific advances culminating in the Industrial Revolution which literally changed the face of the globe and challenged ancient notions of sovereignty and the meaning of international business development. Dr Wallace Ford said that the great wealth of the British Empire was firmly rooted in the Raj, in other words, rooted in the soil (Pakistan) on which we now stand. He further said that what we now know is that there is no such entity called the United States of America and its great wealth without the genocide committed on the indigenous people of the North American continent, killing millions of the original residents of what is now New York to what is now California, while enslaving millions of Africans and decimating the African continent in the bargain. He also said that the conquest has always played a role in international development. But it is also true that the era of European American conquest took this form of international business development to an unprecedented scale with implications that have affected the planet ever since. Dr Asoka Jinadasa of Intrinsic Leadership Academy, Sri Lanka said that the people of Pakistan are heirs of great Indus Valley and Harapan Civilizations, therefore they carry a gene of entrepreneurship, which may able them to restore the past glory of the country. "People of Mohen Jo Daro were successful entrepreneurs, city planners and they had technical knowhow to such extend that they dug wells, constructed covered sewage system, houses and great bath etc. He said that Pakistan has a potential to lead the world in many areas. Mr. Shamsuddin Shaikh, CEO of Engro Energy Limited talked on the Thar coal project and said that besides working on the project, they with the support of Government of Sindh, have provided 71 percent jobs to local people and also working on their education and health facilities. He further said that they are also working to bring people of Thar into the fold of entrepreneurship by involving them in small businesses and also they are opening shops of embroidery of Thar. Mr. Shamsuddin Shaikh announced that they are opening a campus of NED University and community college in Thar also. Ms Mehr Malik, CFO, Ideas Gul Ahmed, in her speech said that we, today's generation is a lucky one, that enjoys a lot opportunities than their grandparents. "We are living in a time, where things are changing dramatically. This is why; men as well as women have to work together for development and progress of the country. While sharing experiences of her life she said that women should have courage to "ask" about those things, which they couldn't want to do are that are against their interest. Talking about SMIU, Ms. Mehr Malik said this institute has grown rapidly and will earn more recognition in near future. Mr. Naseem Beg, CEO Arif Habib said that there is a weak nexus between universities and industries. He also said that universities have failed to do innovative research work that could help industries to grow according to the needs of time. He suggested forming a think tank that could work on the cooperation of universities and industries. On the last day of the conference three technical sessions were held on various subjects related to economy and business which were also addressed by prominent experts of the country.
## National and International experts address SMIU's 2-Day, 1st International Conference on Management, Business and Leadership

[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/International-Conference-on-Management.jpg>)
The 2-Day, 1st International Conference organized by Department of Business Administration of Sindh Madressatul Islam University on the subject of Management, Business and Leadership with the major theme-University-Industry Nexus, started at a local hotel on Thursday. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU chaired the inaugural session. Besides the national, the experts and academicians of USA, European countries and Sri Lanka also attended it. Addressing the International Conference, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor SMIU said that universities and industries can serve the nation specially its underprivileged class by conducting researches on social, educational, health and gender issues of common folk. He said that universities have intellectual capital, which must be capitalized for research that should be based on the issues, problems, sufferings and also on the welfare of common men. "Research should not be for the sake of research, but it must be for the interests of the country and its masses," Prof. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said and added that industries should cooperate and collaborate with the universities to resolve the problems of poverty and unemployment from the country. Dr Shaikh said that poverty and unemployment are big problems of our country that can be addressed by doing proper research work on it and then finding their solution. He said this conference will produce good results in finding out solutions of social, economic, health and gender related and educational problems of the country, because prominent experts from USA, European countries, Sri Lanka and our own country Pakistan are presenting their research papers on very core issues of the world with reference to Pakistan, in the conference. The Vice Chancellor also congratulated SMIU's Department of Business Administration on organizing this successful international conference. Dr. Jo-Ann Rolle, Dean, School of Business at Medgar Evers College, The City University of New York (CUNY), USA in her paper said that the world of global business is difference. There is diversity of cultures, skills, discipline and diversity of needs. Thus, she said we must find ways to surround ourselves with difference so that we understand the different prisms of opportunity. Dr. Rolle further said that I have lived in a place and time when men and women were separated by race, gender and class to a time and space that all men and women must work together for the survival of our united future. "We must find ways to re-think, re-engineer and re-shape a future that will be sustainable for all," she said and maintained that I am true believer that education changes lives." Dr. Jo-Ann Rolle said that students we are preparing must be creative, resourceful, and intuitive; they must understand that innovation is a necessity because business as usual is a death sentence in a dynamic global economy. Dr. Dalia Streimikiene of Vilnius University, Lithuania, in her presentation on Sustainable Development said that the governments should find out long lasting balance between social, economic and environmental aspects with the help of different dimensions. She was of the view that poverty must be eradicated for sustainable development of any country. Dr. Dalia Streimikiene said we have to improve living standards and wellbeing of all people, promote peace and better societies and reverse the social injustice. She also linked gender equity, human population, health, education and climate change with the sustainable development.

Governor Sindh Mr. Mohammad Zubair, who is also the chancellor of public sector universities of Sindh has appreciated Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh for writing a fantastic book on Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, which, he said, will immensely help the younger generation to understand the life and struggle of the founder of Pakistan. He said this while addressing the launching ceremony of the book titled Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah: Taaleem, Juhid-e-Azadi aur Kamyabiyan", an Udru translation of Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh's book on Saturday evening at the inner courtyard of Sindh Madressatul Islam University. The Governor of Sindh said that in an age when there was a lack of quality research work in the country that book was based on good research that depicted real life of the father of the nation and conveyed the message of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah to its readers. He said that being the head of the alma mater of the founder of Pakistan, it was part of Dr Shaikh's responsibilities to write such a wonderful tome given the fact that most details about the Quaid were available with the SMIU. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/launches-book.jpg>)Mr. Mohammad Zubair said that he was undergoing a feeling full of emotions, which was mainly because he was in the school of study of the Quaid-e-Azam and was talking on a book written on his life and times. He added that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had wanted for a liberal and tolerant Pakistan, where all citizens irrespective of differences of ethnicity and religion could live amicably and peacefully. "Today we also need a liberal and tolerant country as dreamed and desired by the Quaid-e-Azam." He said that there was no ambiguity about the political system to run the country in the mind of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. "He clearly wanted a parliamentary system in Pakistan on the pattern of the British parliamentary system." The Sindh Governor said that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was the best parliamentarian and democrat who believed in the supremacy of the parliament. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Quaid-e-Azam-book.jpg>)"This made him the undisputed leader of all communities of the then undivided India. Apart from a great politician, he was a great lawyer as well. Had he given more time to his profession, which he had left after returning back from England in the middle of 1930s, he would have been among the greatest lawyers of the region." Mr. Mohammad Zubair believed that Pakistan was destined to progress and prosperity no matter odds of the day were not in its favour at the present. He hoped that the political process of the country should continue uninterrupted. Earlier, author of the book, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, in his welcome address spoke on the need of writing that book threadbare. He said that when he went through a variety of biographies on Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah including the books of his sister Ms Fatima Jinnah, Mohammad Ali Siddiqui and others he found certain wrong narratives especially regarding the history of his time spent on education. "Some of them said that he had passed his matriculation examination from the Sindh Madressatul Islam in 1887, which was not correct. He hadn't passed matriculation exams from Sindh Madressatul Islam. Such basic errors compelled me to correct the history with the help of the record that was available at SMI," said Dr Shaikh. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/sindh-university-vc.jpg>)Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh further said that he also went London to get the education record of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's education at Lincoln's Inn. The SMIU vice chancellor said that in a textbook in Sindhi published in 1948, it was mentioned that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was born in Jirrack, now part of district Thatta. "To keep all these things correct with clear perspective along with some other things in my mind I decided to write a book especially for the youth to give them correct life account of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah with the support of his rare pictures," said Dr Shaikh. Dr Shaikh said that Mr. Jinnah was belonging to an underprivileged family, but later he became one of the rich persons of the region through his perpetual struggle and hard work. Mr. Wusatullah Khan, a prominent columnist said it was high time to seriously think why Pakistani youth had got alienated and why "we have failed to run the country according the thoughts and vision of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah". [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/vc-smiu.jpg>)He said that the people of Pakistan had to make the country as visualized by the Quaid-e-Azam especially in light of his speech delivered on 11th August 1947, four days before the creation of Pakistan. He congratulated Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh on writing a good book on Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Dr Mohammad Ajmal Khan, vice chancellor of the University of Karachi said that he had read the book in a single sitting and found it fascinating and informative. "I have read such a good book after a long time," he said, adding that its Urdu translation was marvelous, which made him happy.

## First 2-Day International Conference on Computing and Related Technologies organized by SMIU concludes
29 December 2017
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/2-Day.jpg>)
The first 2-Day International Conference on Computing and Related Technologies, organised by the Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU), in collaboration with the Higher Education of Pakistan, concluded on Friday after three memorandum of understanding were inked by the SMIU, two Romanian universities and a Nigerian college. Some nine experts from abroad and several others from across the country participated in the conference. The SMIU's vice chancellor, Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh signed the MoUs with Dr. Ramona Lile F of University of Arad, Dr Florin Popentiu of University of Oradea and Dr Muahmmad Adamu Jebba of Niger College of Education, Minna, Nigeria. In the MoUs, SMIU and the three institutions of Romania and Nigeria agreed to work together in the field of information technology, and share each other's experience and scholarly work. Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh congratulated the faculty of IT for organizing the successful event, thanked the international scholars who visited Pakistan and shared their knowledge with their counterparts and students in Pakistan. He said the SMIU would be organizing such innovative events in the future as well so that the fields which were hardly touched in the country's scholarly spectrum should be given due importance. Earlier, Prof Gihan Dias of the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, spoke over the challenges of enabling machine translation for low-resourced languages. He said many countries, including Pakistan, used multiple languages, some of which were spoken by only a relatively small number of people. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/MoUs-sign-smiu.jpg>)However, he added, all of these people needed access to the world's knowledge and government and private institutions needed to communicate with people using the language they understood. "Computers and mobile devices need to store data in our own languages, and also process them in sophisticated ways, for example, to provide an answer to a written or spoken question," said Prof Dias. "This technology, called Natural Language Processing, has become the cornerstone of many information services such as translating a document or a web page from one language to another. Today, machine translation works quite well between some languages such as English and Japanese. However, it works less well for languages such as Sindhi, or even Urdu." He said it might not work at all for other - less common - languages. "The main reason for this is that researchers and companies have spent much effort over many years to develop language and linguistic resources and tools for major languages. These are lacking for South Asian languages, which may be consider low-resourced." Prof Dias said two years ago the University of Moratuwa started a project to translate between Sri Lanka's two official languages - Sinhala and Tamil. "It quickly became apparent that in order to develop a translation system, we first needed both language and linguistic resources." He said language resources were collections of text - and other material - in a language, or for a pair of languages. "A common type of resource is a corpus which is a collection of words, sentences, etc. in a language. Copora may be enhanced by including additional information - such as parts of speech - on its contents." [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/iccrt-guest-smiu-vc.jpg>)He said linguistic resources were information - for example, spelling rules and grammar - which showed how a language worked. "Tools are software - such as a spelling checker - which aid language processing." Replying a question he said Mohenjodaro's script could be deciphered through computer technology, which required persistent effort. However, he added so far there was no such software that could help now to decode the ancient script. He said data available regarding Mohenjodaro script was insufficient, thus, it required more time and resources to be enable to read that language. He said human languages were complex and could not be completely understood by the technology, adding, computers needed to handle text, images, and speech etc. Regarding Google Translate, he said, quality might be acceptable for major language pairs, but was poor for less common language pairs, such as South Asian languages. He said Google's objective was to aid understanding. "We need language resources as data of how our languages are used, linguistic resources, and how our languages work, is highly important." Sri Lankan scholar said Google, Bing etc. base their translation systems on huge quantities of data - billions of sentences - and Sinhala and Tamil, like other South Asian languages as Sindhi, Punjabi etc. being low-resourced languages don't have such large amounts of data; and it was difficult to find good parallel corpora. "We are interested in collaborating with institutes in Pakistan as our language structures are similar and our problems are similar." Dr Hla Myo Tun of Yangon Technological University, Myanmar, spoke over the implementation of distributed control systems for Rice Mill using C#. Dr. Mansoor Ahmed Tahir of Iqra University presented his papers on avoiding broadcasts and loops in multipath topology. Noman Islam of Iqra University presented a paper on 5G network. He said during the past few years, an unbridled surge in the demand of multimedia contents due to emergence of wide range of computing gadgets and the decline in the bandwidth prices. He said mobile users were shifting from connection oriented to content oriented mode. A wide range of techniques had been used to cope with emerging demands of next generation networks. He said if the popular contents could be proactively cached at the edges closer to the user, the backhaul network could be offloaded. "Caching can not only avoid the network congestion but also reduce the latency incur in response to user request." Prof Manzoor Ahmed Hashmani of University of Technology Petronas, Malaysia, said business intelligence and analytics were in high demand as organizations seek to use information assets to improve business outcomes, customer relationships, and operational efficiency. He said organizations were closely watching emerging technology trends to discover the next great competitive advantage in the use of information. One trend is easy to identify: more information. "Data volumes are growing across the board, with organizations seeking to tap new sources generated by social media and online customer behavior. This trend is spurring tremendous interest in better access and analysis of the variety of information available in unstructured or semi-structured content sources." Dr. Amir Manzoor of the Bahria University, Karachi, said Pakistani businesses, just like those in many other developing countries lack e-CRM (customer relationship management) system. "A survey conducted by the Global Forum indicated that only 6 per cent of businesses in developing countries had successfully implemented e-CRM systems." Dr. Gabor Kiss of Obuda University, Hungary discussed the possibilities of changing information security awareness of the students in the higher education. Bilal Ameen of ILMA University Karachi spoke over international leading stock market under the umbrella of information technology and Syed Mohammad Faran of Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology presented paper on interior design e-commerce website. Shahzeb Soomro of SZABIST, Larkana, presented his paper on the security of 5G technology. He said as growing number of cybercrimes had increased, the requirement of privacy and security mechanism got higher to prevent isolation of information by communication between multiple devices and appliances in the application of 5G. Prof Dr Syed Asif Ali, Dean Faculty of IT, Prof. Dr. Aftab Ahmed Shaikh of SMIU, Mr. Bilal Liaquat and Zarlish Khan Tanoli of Bahria University also spoke.
## 1st International Conference on Computing and Related Technologies, organized by SMIU began
28 December 2017
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Dr-Muhammad-Ali-Shaikh-smiu-vc.jpg>)
The first-ever international conference on information technology organized by the Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) in collaboration with Higher Education Commission of Pakistan began at a local hotel on Thursday. The conference was declared open by Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh, vice chancellor of the SMIU, as dozens of international and Pakistani scholars were there. Dr. Shaikh welcomed the guests from Pakistan and abroad and said the mankind at present was living in the era of revolution of information technology in which 3.6 billion people of the world were enjoying the facility of internet. "This has turned the world in a global village, thus, has created its own challenges and issues, which too would be discussed during this conference," said Dr. Shaikh. He said information technology was a huge revolution of the history of mankind in which without possessing any piece of land or owning some industry, people could earn their livelihoods through a computer device and knowledge of information technology. He added, without class difference, IT had offered opportunities to the poor and small nations equal to what it offered to the rich countries, however, the real challenge was for the developing countries as to how they could get benefit from it. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/International-Conference-smiu.jpg>)Dr. Shaikh said during the conference the key focus would be put on the practical usages of information technology that could be advantageous for the people of Pakistan and other developing countries. He advised to the faculty and students of the SMIU to get maximum benefit from the rare event. Earlier, Prof Syed Asif Ali, dean of the faculty of information technology, said in his welcoming speech that it was the first conference of its kind for the SMIU and the country itself. He said the SMIU had received around 60 research papers from as many scholars belonging to the countries in Europe, North America, Africa, Antarctica and across Asia, of which, some 40 such papers had been selected to be presented in the conference. He said it was the first conference globally in which a session had been dedicated for the people of special needs who had improved their way of life by getting benefit from the information technology. Dr. Valentina Emilia Balas of the University of Arad, Romania, said it was a highly important meet which would employ immense advantage in the fields of science and technology and to the society as a whole. She said more IT professionals were needed who could work in a better way for the mankind. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/1st-International-Conference.jpg>)In her paper, she explained the low power consumption and high reliability in the case of the Brain comparing with silicon-based computers. "Our goal is to advance understanding of architectures matching the novel nano-devices and communication schemes performing at ultra-low power and enhanced reliability all brain inspired," she said. It was the first time in any conference in the country that a segment was dedicated to the special people who got benefited from the evolution of information technology. Dr. Sabir Michael, a research scholar and a professor in Karachi University's social work department, spoke over the role of computer technology in benefiting the people who could not see like him and other special people. He said all disabilities needed computers. He urged the universities in the country to assess the needs of people with different kinds of disabilities. "Try to understand which needs are required to be taken care of in the local context," said Dr Michael. He said it was ever evolving information technology that had made the special people to consume their abilities as normally as other people. "Some years ago, I found it really hard when I came back home from abroad and was not able to communicate to my family to pick me up from the airport. Now I am efficient enough to use this technology as normally as one could do," he added. He said information technology which did not help and emancipate the vulnerable was 'useless'. He said the researchers, universities and companies should make devices supported by indigenous languages like Urdu, Sindhi, and Pashto etc. He said same thing had already been done in India where those devices and gadgets supported by Hindi and other languages were there to help special people. "There are many blind people who are in software engineering and they need support and encouragement." He said computer technology helped decreasing special people's dependency and supporting them in becoming as normal people. Akhtar Waqar Tabish, a research scholar of the department of computer science of the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, said he had lost both his hands in a horrible train accident when he was just four. He said the life was extremely hard after that accident, but he learnt to live with the disability. "The fact that I have lost both hands has not deprived me of wings; not stopped me from getting education and becoming a professional," said Tabish. He said he was inspired to do his own business. "I have created opportunities for myself and will create opportunities for others in shape of jobs," he said. He said new technologies was panacea for disabilities. Bionic hands were there to help people like him and he would soon use that technology. He thanked the people who were developing technology to cater to the needs of disabled people and allowing them to grow and lead a normal life. Florin Popentiu Vladicescu, professor, UNESCO Chair in Information and Communication Engineering, University of Oradea, Romania spoke over the new complexity, generated both by the size of data collections from the field, and the integration of systems in "System of Systems" to assure the fulfillment of objectives with respect to the risk management requirements. Prof Valiuddin Abbas, registrar, Hamdard University, presented his paper to understand the human activities and behavior which had received much importance recently as it was helpful for a number of scientists like medical specialists, computer engineers and those involved in design and development of intelligent systems to identify human behavior, their requirements and intentions, and to get insight of their thought process. Dawood Shamim of the Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology spoke over his project regarding sign language communicator by using Leap Motion Controller. Faraz Zaidi, an advisor at Health Analytics, Ontario, and Canada presented his paper on the role of data science and Its implications in improving health care, in which he said data science had evolved provided a new information management approach which supported data-driven informed decision making. Aqeel-ur-Rehman from the Hamdard University said escalating use of wireless network and miniaturization of electronic devices had allowed the grasp of WBANs, which is one of the latest technologies in Healthcare domain. WBAN consisted of a variety of intelligent bio-sensors that were attached on or implanted in the body. "The core responsibility of WBAN is to collect, process, aggregate patient's data and send it to the centralized healthcare database." Azhar Ali Shah of the University of Sindh, Rafi Ullah Khan, Hina Mahmood from Qurtaba University, Peshawar, and Sidra Sultana of the National University of Science and Technology, Rawalpindi, also spoke.
## Foundation stone of the Sindh Madressatul Islam University unveiled
25 December 2017
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Foundation-stone-smiu.jpg>)
The Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) on Monday formally got the foundation stone laid by Governor Muhammad Zubair on its new campus in the Education City, Malir. The new campus is a part of the designated site for the Education City established by the Sindh government. On the occasion, Governor Zubair said he was proud to have visited the mausoleum of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and unveiled the foundation stone for the new campus of an institution, which was alma mater of the founder of the nation, the same day. "It is indeed great honour for me to be in this ceremony when the Sindh Madressatul Islam University is beginning construction of its new campus. It is one huge occasion that the Prime Minister is presiding over a function for another mega project of the Islamia College University and I am here on his behalf doing the same in SMIU. They are the two of the three institutions to which Quaid-e-Azam had bequeathed one third of his properties through his Last Will," said Governor Muhammad Zubair. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Governor-Zubair.jpg>)About establishment of the new campus of the SMIU, he said it was the first campus of a public sector university where foundation stone for a new campus had been placed in the Education City. He said it was good that every political party in the office chipped in for making the Quaid's alma mater a great place of learning. "I am here to assist to the SMIU administration in completing this project well in time." He said that recently he had visited the Lincoln's Inn in UK where a bust of the Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was inaugurated and placed in the 15th century educational institution, which was a great honour for all Pakistanis and one satisfying reason to be proud of. He said the people of Pakistan new sketchy and mostly superficial things about the life of Quaid-e-Azam, and every Pakistani should know more about the Father of the Nation. "He was the best lawyer in the Commonwealth in 1915 when he had not entered in his forties; and was the best politician who would lead debates in the assemblies. He was nobody when he returned home from Lincoln's Inn and he turned the best lawyer in town when he was just 25," said the governor. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/mashaikh-vc.jpg>)The Quaid was so popular that he hardly needed electioneering to win elections. He urged the provinces to spend more on education since they would get more funds from the centre. Earlier, Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh, vice chancellor of the SMIU, said the occasion was highly important; and it was the only second such occasion with equal significance in 130 years. He said Viceroy of British India Lord Dufferin inaugurated the Sindh Madressatul Islam's historical Main Building on November 14, 1887. He said the day for the foundation stone was selected as December 25, which was the birth anniversary of the institution's most illustrious alumni. "Quaid-e-Azam spent four-and-half years of his life from 1887 to 1892 in SMI, which was the maximum period he spent in an educational institution, more than all other institutions he was enrolled with," said Dr Shaikh. He said the Quaid could not stop from being expressive in 1943 when the SMI was elevated as college. He made a handsome donation and led others to do the same. On another occasion, when his will was read after his death, the Quaid donated one-third of his property to the SMI equal to what he donated to the Islamia College University Peshawar and Aligarh Muslim University. "At that time, the SMI got Rs10,800,000 from his donation." [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Governor-Muhammad-Zubair.jpg>)About the new campus, Dr Shaikh said it would be completed in three phases. The federal government had approved Rs1.57 billion for the first phase which would be completed in three years. He said during the first phase, infrastructure would be made, hostels for 200 girls and as many boys; 35 staff residences, gym, sports facilities, a building housing the vice chancellor's secretariat and other offices would be made. The total cost of the project is Rs12 billion. He said the HEC had funded the project. While the Sindh government and federal government had owned it and both had chipped in accordingly. He said former president Asif Ali Zardari and former chief minister of Sindh, Syed Qaim Ali Shah had supported for the cause immensely. Besides, he added, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah had allotted 10 acres of land in Hawkesbay area. Ghulam Raza Bhatti, member operation and planning, HEC, said the HEC's 129 projects in 112 universities of the country were going on. He said in the past 15 years, the HEC had completed 847 projects. At present, he said, projects were being funded for the University of Sindh, SMIU, Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto University of Law, IBA Sukkur etc. He said the HEC was establishing 66 campuses in various districts of the country. In Sindh, he said six such campuses had been established and five of them were functional in Umerkot, Shahdadkot, Ghotki, Jacobabad and Kashmore. Mr. Gul Mohammad Leghari from the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform, the era of industrialization, which dominated the world in 18th century, was overwhelmed by the knowledge-based economic development in 1990s, which too was there to be replaced by the looming digital era in 2030. He said in the 11th 5-year plan in 2014, Rs18 billion were allocated for the higher education, which had been doubled to Rs36 billion in the current ADP. He said there were 130 public sector universities with 1.1 million enrolment in 2013, which had now increased to 188 with 1.6 million enrolment. Similarly, he said the ratio of girls students in those universities had improved from 42 per cent in 2013 to 48 per cent now.

[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Last-Day.jpg>)
The arts and ideas festival organized by the Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) was concluded on Sunday after four eventful days which were decorated by international lectures given by foreign scholars, distinguished lectures by national experts and several other activities in which faculty and students both enthusiastically participated. Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh, vice chancellor of the SMIU, said the key purpose of the festival was to familiarize the youth with new ideas that could help them succeed in their future life. He said the festival was organized on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of Pakistan's independence and the new generation would have to play their positive role to make the country a modern nation in the world. A report about the details of the events held during the four days of the festival was also presented. Before the conclusion of the festival some interesting and thought-provoking sessions were held, of which 'development of Karachi as a megacity of Sindh' stood on the top. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Last-Day-pic.jpg>)Eminent development experts Arif Hasan and Yasmin Lari took part in the session in which they revealed certain aspects that hindered the city from becoming a jewel of Pakistan. Mr. Hasan the chief hindrance in making Karachi a truly modern megacity was the fact that the city's matters were being controlled by the market and not politicians and bureaucracy. "The city's important matters are being controlled by the market, while Lahore is developing because it is being controlled by politicians and bureaucracy as it should be," said Mr Hasan. He said a comprehensive planning was highly needed to develop the metropolitan city. Besides, he added, the citizens of Karachi should come forward and own the city. Mr. Hasan said there were numerous reasons for destruction of the old heritage of Karachi. Among them, he added, the fact remained there that those historical buildings and places were located in the areas where it was extremely hard to save them. "Unless we get certain strong institutions, no positive change in the city is forthcoming. While, the institutions which we had in the past have already become history," he said. He said there was no master plan offered by the Karachi Development Authority. Besides, certain legislation related to the issue had messed up the situation further. He asked universities and students to play their role for betterment of the city. Mr. Hasan said Karachi could not become a world class city with the present propositions. He added it needed better planning, modern modes of transportation, construction of footpaths etc. Ms. Lari, chief of the Heritage Foundation of Pakistan, said the city was saturated with ever-increasing population, but, it offered no better means of transportation. Besides, she added, supply of clean drinking water was an issue while the sewerage system had broken down. "Trees are being cut, footpaths have disappeared and circular railway system was a thing of the glorious past," she said. She said the city needed toilets, particular its female population. Besides, once a rich city, now suffered from abject poverty. Ms. Lari said most of the heritage buildings in the city were stone-built and needed heavy funds to get restored. "Every citizen should play one's part to make Karachi a clean and better city." She also called for eradication of "mafias" to improve the public transport system. Delivering the distinguished lecture, Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, federal secretary for planning and development and former commissioner of Karachi, said administrative accountability was more needed than the financial accountability. He said many projects were pompously inaugurated but because of little follow-up they got non-functional. "The same has been happening in Karachi. A number of such projects have met the same fate in Karachi. Unless administrative accountability is not begun, the country cannot progress in real terms," said Mr. Siddiqui. He said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was extremely important project for the country because construction of roads was very foundation of a country's development. "Through this project Pakistan will link with other countries of the world, and it would fetch wealth in terms of increased exports. The CPEC will help increase the country's GDP by 23 per cent," he said. He dispelled the impression that more Chinese than Pakistanis were employed with the CPEC projects. Dr Weimin Delcroix-Tang, a professor with University of Sanya, Hainan, China, presented her essay on the double-sidedness of the oceanic culture of China's tropical island Hainan. She said located in between the South China Sea, the eastern and western, marine and continental, indigenous and Hakka cultures met and interacted. In a session on women and gender issues in Pakistan, Mrs. Shaista Muhammad Ali, honorary advisor on cultural and gender affairs, SMIU, Mehnaz Rehman of Aurat Foundation and scholar Khalida Ghous spoke. They called upon mothers to keep their children away from being affected with gender discrimination. They said anti-harassment law helped keeping safe both women and men. They called upon the government to effectively implement the pro-women laws. Ms Naheed Memon, chairperson, Sindh Board of Investment, advised the youth to start their own businesses instead of waiting for jobs. She said expertise was more important for starting a business than the wealth. Dr. Sahar Ansari, poet and educationist, spoke over the creative and philosophical aspects of Dewan-i-Ghalib, Quratulain Hyder's Aag ka Darya, and Ashfaq Ahmed's Zaviya. He said the era of Ghalib was full of bards and masters like Ibrahim Zauq, Momin Khan Momin, Bahadur Shah Zafar etc., but Ghalib earned more respect and fame as he had greater imagination and had mastery in reflecting his thought process. He said Aag Ka Darya covered the subcontinent's history spread over 2,500 years stuffed with fantastic style of narration. He said Ashfaq Ahmed was inspired by Shaikh Sa'adi. Ameena Sayyid, managing director, Oxford University Press, Pakistan, spoke over the rampant book piracy issues in Pakistan. She said it deprived writers from being paid royalty they deserved and also cost heavily on publishers. She said reading habit had not faded away in Pakistan, but it was a country of many cultures and entities, thus, the standards vary vis-à-vis topics of books. During the festival, some 40 sessions were held and attracted good audiences. They included lectures by international and national speakers, panel discussions, screening of documentaries, photography and painting exhibitions and singing and quiz competitions. Shah Latif's seven heroines were depicted in tableaus during four days.
## Events of the third day of SMIU's Festival of Arts and Ideas
9 December 2017

An eminent scholar from the North Carolina Central University on Saturday gave a thought-provoking lecture discussing the 'politics' that the formulation of the Sindhi script ensued 170 years ago a few years after Sir Charles Napier conquered Sindh against the wishes of most of the bigwigs of the British colonial empire. Dr. Matthew A. Cook, a professor of NCCU, USA, gave an international lecture on the third day of the four-day Arts and Ideas Festival being organized by the Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) at its campus. Dr. Cook, a PhD in anthropology and an expert on Asian studies and Indian languages, gave his lecture on the 'origins of the Sindhi language'. However, he focused chiefly on the issues that arose when it came to decide for the standard script for a language, which reigned the region for millennia. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/third-day-smiu-vc.jpg>)He said there were four theories about the origins of Sindhi, three of which explored its roots in the Indo-Aryan system. However, the remaining one insisted that today's modern Sindh was derived from the Proto-Dravidian system with other Dravidian languages and the Indo-Aryan system as a whole as its sisters. "I personally have issues accepting this fourth theory,"said the professor. "This model is hard to sustain." He, however, said there were different answers about the origins of Sindhi language. However, there were certain amusing information available in the records, which gave fascinating debate and intellectual argument between the two British officers, also eminent linguists, when it came to decide for the script for the modern Sindhi. Captain George Stack and Richard Francis Burton, the two officers of the colonial British empire, were poles apart when they recommended for the scripts for Sindhi in late 1840s. The former endorsed and campaigned for the Khudawadi or Khudabadi system, on which Bhaibands, the financiers of the colonial empire, were at ease to. Richard Burton had extensive interaction with the Sindhi Muslims who believed that the Arabic Naskh system would be much convenient and fluent for writing Sindhi. Both officers had given their recommendations in writing. Before that, surveys of various officers working in Sindh, showed most recommended Sindhi against those who recommended Persian and Hindustani for school language, while the score was 10-8 in favour of Persian. Another survey for the standard script showed two votes for Naskh, and three each for Khudawadi and others. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/third-day-festival.jpg>)Lord Falkland, the Governor of Bombay Presidency, first decided for the Khudawadi script, said Dr Cook. However, he said, the decision was reverted for Naskh purely on political grounds when the British decided to rule Sindh like the rest of India by engaging Hindu Amils, who were best at administering the region and collect revenues. "It was just Charles Napier who decided to conquer Sindh for the imperial grandeur, though, most of other British officers had other idea. Sindh was a country with debt at first, but, when it was given to Amils the British decided to keep it." Both the British officers, Stack and Burton left Sindh in 1849 for different reasons. Stack came earlier in 1853 and died the same year. Dr. Cook said Stack was himself had not used the Khudawadi script for Sindhi when he compiled grammar Sindhi and English-Sindhi dictionary. In the distinguished lecture series, I.A. Rehman, human rights defender and columnist, and journalist Iftikhar Ahmed rendered separate speeches. Mr. Rehman said the Sindhi society was earlier highly liberal, which would accept new ideas and encourage critical thinking. However, he added, but the situation had not remained the same and the society was becoming a victim of division. "Still, Sindh enjoys good liberal and progressive values, but, the worst part is that it is fast reducing." The universities were not free to formulate and teach their own curricula, they were still being controlled by the government, thus, the level of education was not at par with the modern standards. He said the governments were so heavily involved in controlling the education system that the acts of universities made their faculties binding to seek for government's permission before leaving abroad. He said working women were being harassed with impunity at workplaces, which was one key hindrance in the country's progress. Journalist Iftikhar Ahmed said a positive change in the country was not possible until the turnout ratio in general elections was not improved substantially. "Any reforms, which are made without making this happen, will be useless,"said Mr Ahmed. "At least 60 per cent turnout ratio in general elections is must for the real change in the country." He asked the youth to take active part in elections and use their vote for the change. Since 1970, when the first general elections were held in Pakistan, it was in 2013 when the turnout ratio witnessed some increase. He said political parties had the key to change the game and incentivize people to cast their votes. However, he added, it could only be made possible when the political parties were themselves strong, carried programs which reflected basic issues of the general public and had good leadership and cadres. Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of the SMIU, said democracy and elections were interrelated with each other, adding, people chose their representatives through election, but, "due to the tradition of elect-ables, people could not elect their real representatives". During a session on environmental issues, experts said the government should decide it once and for all whether economy was more important or the increasing environmental pollution. They said environmental pollution was a grave issue, which should have been on the top of the government's agenda. They added coal-fired power plants would help better economy of the country, but they would be hugely disastrous for the environment. They asked the government to explore and give attention to environment-friendly sources of power generation. Zeeshan Ansari, Prof Amin Qureshi, Waseem Ahmed and Tanya Saleem spoke in the session. Educationist Abbas Hussain spoke over the English classical literature in the event's 'bookshelf session'. Journalists and TV anchors, in another session on electronic and digital media, said the importance of electronic media was diminishing because of sensationalism and quantitative, instead of qualitative, journalism. They said the race for ratings had hugely affected TV journalism's credibility. Najia Asher claimed the talk shows' ratings on TVs was decreasing and the owners were looking into it seriously. She said social media had emerged as a powerful facet of the modern journalism. Kamal Siddiqui, director, Centre for Excellence in Journalism of the IBA, said one could not hope of improvement in the electronic media which was busy in the race of ratings. He asked students to use the social media sites with care as they were tools where the user was shouldered with more responsibility as one was in command of his/her actions. Prof Saleem Memon said HT Sorley was the first foreigner who did PhD on Shah Latif and introduced his wonderful poetry to the world. In another session translations of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, Baba Bulleh Shah and Mevlana Rumi's poetry were presented on stage. The festival also featured tableaux to highlight Bhitai's four heroines (Surmis) Sassui, Suhni, Marui, and Noori.
## Second Day of SMIU's Festival of Arts and Ideas
8 December 2017
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Second-Day.jpg>)
The Sindh Madressatul Islam University's Festival of Arts and Ideas was formally inaugurated by its Vice Chancellor, Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh on Friday at its inner courtyard as scholars from abroad and from various parts of the country accompanied him. While addressing the ceremony Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU, who presided the event said: "We have to introduce our younger generation with their cultural and moral values, which they have lost due to the influence of other world cultures." "We have organized this festival at the place from where founder of Pakistan Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had received his early education since this festival is a part of the celebrations in connection with the 70th years of Pakistan's independence. Dr. Shaikh further said the Indus Valley Civilization was among the great ancient civilizations of the world including the Chinese, the Greek, Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations. "Almost 90 percent of Pakistan's area is on the location, where Indus Valley Civilization existed," Dr. Shaikh said and added that as the Indus Valley Civilization was one of the most developed eras of the human history, that should inspire the young people of the modern times to make Pakistan a developed country in every field of life. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Second-Day-festival.jpg>)He said that innovative ideas channel through deep thinking and that festival would help students turning innovative and creative. Dr. Ambreen Fazal, convener of the festival and in-charge chairperson of the department of media and communication studies of the SMIU welcomed the guests. She said that SMIU was the only university in the country that had organized such a festival. Prof Thomas Dahnhardt, an expert on South Asian languages, religions and culture, gave an insightful rendition in the first of the international lecture series over a highly interesting topic discussing and exploring contacts between Hindu and Muslim Sufi spirituality in South Asia. Dr Dahnhardt, however, made it clear that Sufism was an integral part of Islam, which could not be detached from the religion. "Sufism should not be detached from Islam and Islam should also not be detached or deprived from Sufism," said the Italian scholar with international repute in command on eastern languages, cultures and religions. He said ever since Muslims had set their feet on South Asian soil the ensuing relations between the pre-existing cultural environment and the dynamic dimension inherent to Islam had led to numerous fruitful contacts on multiple levels between these two civilisations - the Arab or Muslim and the Indus Valley civilisations. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Second-Day-festival-students.jpg>)Dr Dahnhardt said over time, the process of reciprocal acknowledgement and assimilation allowed for the emergence of the fascinating cultural environment described as Indo-Islamic civilisation. "In this context, the role played by spiritual authorities in bringing together communities through the channel of the common language of popular devotion has been attested and recognised." But, he added, it was on the less visible plane of intellectual and spiritual insight that Sufi and Hindu masters had been successful in exploring a terrain for both traditions to rest on thereby developing a common ground for the élite and the common folk. In his scholarly essay the scholar affiliated with the University of Venice explored certain aspects of such spiritual collaboration as it occurred over time in South Asia. He began his lecture for the past 1300 years since the Muslims set foot in South Asia. During his essay he discussed various orders of the Sufism and their interaction with the Hindu yogis especially that fostered the tradition to 'go deep in the religion' in the search for the greatest truth. Earlier, 10 documentaries or short films, which were shortlisted out of 22 submissions by the jury were screened at Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium of the university. These documentaries were prepared by students of various universities of the country. The jury comprising Ahmed Shah, president, Arts Council of Pakistan Karachi and Anjum Rizvi, a film producer.

Zaidi, president, the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Zahid Ali Channar, dean, Management, business administration and commerce and Mahanoor Pervaiz , student, SMIU participated in a panel discussion, on the subject of "State of Economy in Pakistan." Nasir Zaidi said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would help Pakistan in approaching the international market and would immensely benefit the country's economy. He advised the youth not to wait for jobs after graduation, instead, they should start online business, which would provide them opportunities of good livelihood. Businessman Atiqur Rehman said CPEC would offer greater job opportunities and reduce expenditure on power, thus, would benefit the country's economy.

## SMIU pays great tribute to Mohammad Ibrahim Joyo by organizing a literary reference
19 November 2017
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/m-Ibrahim-Joyo.jpg>)
Pakistan's senior politician, intellectual, writer and former student of Sindh Madressatul Islam, Mr. Rasool Bux Palijo has said that Mohammad Ibrahim Joyo was a great theorist of Pakistan and an extra ordinary person, who had never compromised on his principles, preached for fundamental rights of common man and worked for Sindhi literature and language till his death. He said this while addressing the Literary Reference organized by Sindh Madressatul Islam University in the honor of its alumnus and former teacher late Mohammad Ibrahim Joyo, on Sunday night, in its premises. Mr. Rasool Bux Palijo, 87, who had remained student of Mr. Mohammad Ibrahim Joyo at Sindh Madressatul Islam in 1940s, said that although his health was not permitting him to travel, but he came here at his Alma-Mater Sindh Madressah from Hyderabad just to pay tribute to his great teacher and a great intellectual of Pakistan Saen Mohammad Ibrahim Joyo.

"I had never felt in my life for a single moment that Joyo sahib should had not done this or that thing.

Recalling his school days at SMIU, Mr. Palijo said that one day Joyo sahib had enquired from me about my knowledge of English language, and I had replied in negative, then he suggested me to read English novels. Afterwards, I acted upon his advise and read many English novels written by great novelists of the world. Such practice changed me totally. [](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/smiu-guest01.jpg>)Rasool Bux Palijo further said that Mohammad Ibrahim Joyo was not a teacher of that kind, who were teaching students just to get passed in their examinations, but he was a teacher of that nature, who were creating new persons, having social and national consciousness, love and respect for people and play their role for betterment of the nation and society.

Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) has said that young generation of the country needs counseling to resolve their problems facing specially in universities. He said this while addressing the "Faculty Advisory Initiative" program, organized by Quality Enhancement Cell (QEC) of SMIU, on Friday at Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium of the university.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that SMIU has started a pilot program of academic counseling for its students through faculty. In this respect SMIU's faculty members will be nominated to give two hours in a week to various groups of students for academic counseling.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Faculty-Advisory.jpg>)
The Vice Chancellor further said that today's young generation is most sensitive, and from parents to teachers, all these persons instead of supporting them, are imposing their decisions upon them. This is why; a large number of young generation is confused today. While citing the example from the past Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that teachers of the past were most kind, sympatric, dedicated and supportive to their students. They were used to establish a bond of respect with their students, but today there is lack of interaction between teachers and students. If this sort of interaction would have not been necessary then, there was no need of presence of a teacher in person, in any institution. Hence, a teacher must play his/her role of guide, advisor and councilor.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that the SMIU has a great tradition of teacher-student interaction, as in the past, SMIU was used to support its students. Even it was trying to get suitable jobs for its students in other institutions, after completion of their education. Today, we are reviving such culture in our institution. Hence, a teacher has to play both roles of a teacher and advisor/counselor for grooming and growth of the students.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/FAdvisory-Initiative.jpg>)

Even there was no modern school for Muslims of Sindh, which were 75 percent of Sindh's total population. There were only a few schools of Zoroastrian community, Hindu Community and colonial rulers. Also, there were only three matriculate Muslims in Sindh at that time.

Vice Chancellor of SMIU said that, such situation compelled Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi and his friends to establish a modern school for Muslims of Sindh. He said that the first college (D.J Arts College) was established in 1887 just two years after establishment of SMI and first university was set up in April 1947 in Sindh.
"At that time there were only two classes in Sindh as Zamindar (landlord) class and Hari (peasant) class. There was no middle class in Sindh. That is why, the absolute Muslim majority of Sindh was deprived of their basic rights, because landlords were not interested in education of the poor population," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said and added that in later days when a middle class person attained a some social position, he took a mission to educate young generation of Sindh by establishing a modern institution-Sindh Madressatul Islam.

Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that in later days this institution produced great leaders including founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who led the nation for their Independence and created a new country-Pakistan. He said that Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had a great love and reverence for his Alma-Mater, that is why he had bequeathed one third of his personal property to SMI in 1939 through his Last Will and had inaugurated "Sindh Madressah College" in 1943.
Talking on the present status of the institution, Dr Shaikh said that today this great institution is working as a university and imparts quality education to the young generation as continuity of its great traditions set during the last 132 years. The Vice Chancellor also congratulated the entire nation on the 133rd celebration of Alma-Mater of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other prominent persons.
The program was followed by performance of well-known young mystic singer Sanam Marvi. She sung poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Baba Bulleh Shah, Faiz Ahmed Faiz and other prominent poets of the country.

## Sindh Madressatul Islam University celebrates Independence Day of Pakistan with great national spirit
14 August 2017
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/celebrates-Independence-Day.jpg>)
The Alma-Mater of Founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah organized variety of programs to celebrate the 71st Foundation Day of Pakistan in its premises. The feelings of proud and success were visible from faces of students of the university,SMIU Model School, faculty and staff members of the institution.
The first event was Flag Hoisting Ceremony, that was held at the ground of the SMIU at 9.00 pm, which was performed by Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU. A large number of students, faculty and staff members attended it. Here while congratulating the participants and people of Pakistan, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that, it is a greatest day for people of Pakistan as on this day, 70 years ago, they had achieved their Independence and separate homeland named Pakistan.
The second program was held in the Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium, which was organized by various societies of SMIU and chaired by Vice Chancellor Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh. On the occasion SMIU's students presented speeches, national songs, skits and culture shows, representing all provinces of the country. It was a great show of talent of SMIU's students who claimed true heirs of the greatest alumnus of this institution Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
The third event was organized by the students of SMIU Model School in the same auditorium. The little angels of the school were clad in green shirts and carrying national flags in their hands. They also presented thought provoking speeches, dramas, national songs and other items that reflected the stories of the struggle of Pakistan.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/celebrates-Independence-Day-smiu.jpg>)
In his speech Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU talked on the main reasons of creation of Pakistan with reference to the ideals of founder of the country Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah in detail and said that throughout the Independence Movement Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had never uttered a single word of hate against his political opponents including Gandhi and Nehru, but he always advocated for the rights of Muslims of undivided India and then creation of Pakistan in more civilized language and in peaceful manner. "Even he had felt deep pain on the events of massacre during the partition, because he was not in its favor at any cost," Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh said and added that the massacre of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs was due to planned mismanagement of the then British rulers of India. If they had wanted, they had saved lives of one million people who were killed and 10 million people who were uprooted from their abodes during the separation.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that on this stage when Pakistan is completing 70 years of its Independence we should think about the next 70 years of the country and must work on the ideology of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, which was based on better law and order situation in the country, eradication of corruption, favoritism, nepotism, black marketing and equal rights for all citizens of the country including minorities and women.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/Independence-Day-smiu.jpg>)
"One can gauge the high reverence and importance of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah for women that firstly his wifeRattanbai was accompanied with him in his most social gatherings and after her demise, his sister Miss Fatima Jinnah was attending most political and social activities along with him," Dr Shaikh said and added that it was ironic that we could not see wives or other women relatives of Gandhi and Nehru participating in political activities along with them, but Mr. Jinnah was believing in equal participation of women in the politics also.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh stressed upon the students of SMIU that they must forward the legacy of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah as his custodian, because Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was also used to sit and read in the classrooms, in which you (SMIU's students) are sitting and reading today. So, it is SMIU's students' prime duty and responsibility to make the Pakistan strong, prosperous, tolerate and peaceful in the coming 70 years.

In addition to that, other scholarships under the "Global Undergraduate Program" are also being offered to the students.

Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) has said that the gender inequity prevails all over the world, but in Sindh male members of society respect and extend reverence to female members at large, and we have inherited such valued tradition from our ancestors. He said this while addressing at the program, which was organized by SMIU with collaboration of Aurat Foundation and USAID to observe the National Women's Day at its auditorium on Monday. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that the great mystic poet of Sindh Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai has sung heroic role of seven women in his poetry and presented them as a symbol of courage, struggle and sacrifice. He further said that in our society males and females are victimized; therefore, it is not fair to accelerate the wave that only women are victimized. "Women must talk about their rights and also must fought for them, but they come out from victim hood. Because this kind of wave will depress and discourage young girls who have not facing problems of gender inequity and striving for their bright career with enthusiasm. Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh further said that majority of male members of our society didn't believe in gender inequity, therefore, suggested that we shouldn't advocate for conflict between male and female but must believe in cooperation between these two inseparable human entities. "It is true that there is gender inequity in the society, but there are also some natural causes of it, which must be addressed," Dr Shaikh said and added that girl and boy students must concentrate on their education and career. "If women have good education, expertise and good job, they will command respect at home and also in the society. Hence, they must concentrate on their education and career." He also said that Karo Kari was not a tradition of Sindh, but it has come from other areas to Sindh. Earlier, Ms. Mahnaz Rehman, Resident Director of Aurat Foundation in her speech said our nation can progress without providing equal opportunities to male and women. She said that Father of the Nation Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had given great importance to women during the Movement of Independence and also encouraged her sister Ms. Fatima Jinnah to participate in social and political activities. She said that the then prime minister of Pakistan Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani has declared 12 February as the National Women's Day in 2010 by paying tribute to the women who had agitated for their rights on February 12, 1993 and were beaten by police in Lahore.

## Distinguished linguist Dr Traiq Rehman delivers lecture at SMIU
07 February 2017
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/distinguishe-linguist.jpg>)
Dr Traiq Rehman, a noted linguist of Pakistan has said that Sindhi language has remained most developed since centuries by its rich literature and it was the main reason that British rulers made it official language of the province. He said this while delivering a lecture on "Language Policy in British India" at Sindh Madressatul Islam University on Tuesday at its Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium.
Dr Tariq Rehman said that poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and other classical poets of Sindh and folk stories had made Sindhi a rich language. Therefore, the British rulers had not created Sindhi language but they only standardized it. It was the language of majority people of Sindh that is why they made it official language of lower courts and was medium of instruction of schools and journalism.
Dr Tariq Rehman further said that British language policy was to use English in the domains of power just as Persian was used earlier. In the lower domains of power, however, they used the vernacular language of the province which, as in the case of the Punjab and present-day KP, was not the mother tongue of the people. They promoted Urdu in all these areas as well as in the area now called U.P. The vernacular-English controversy initiated by their policies are alive in South Asia.
He maintained that in the British India there was Orientalist phase, which started from 1780 and continued up to 1835. In this phase British rulers besides introducing English in Colonial India, supported Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit languages. Apart from it, they supported Bengali in Bengal and Sindhi in Sindh, bud they introduced Urdu in Punjab, NWFP (present KP) and Balochistan due to their political reasons. "British introduced English language in British India to consolidate their power," Dr Tariq Rehman commented.
Dr Traiq Rehman further said that there was also Orientalist-Anglicist Controversy in those days, where common man of British India were against English language, while elite class and religious scholars such as Shah Abdul Aziz were in favour of English, and he had also given Fatwa in its favour. Thus, there was general prejudice in Muslims as well as Hindus against English language.
Dr Tariq Rehman said that the first modern Muslim educational institution was opened in Calcutta in 1781 with the name of Calcutta Madressah," Dr Tariq Rehman said and maintained that in later days English became the language of higher administration (covenanted civil service), higher judiciary, officer corps of the armed forces, higher and elitist education, media and commerce.
Talking about the initiatives taken for Learning English in India he said that in 1774 the Supreme Court was established in Calcutta and in 1816 the natives of Calcutta subscribed to establish an Anglo-Indian college. He said that at that time the reformers like David Hare (1775 -1852) and Ram Mohan Roy (1772 - 1833) encouraged Indians to learn English. In 1832 a parliamentary committee recommended that Indians should be employed in the civil service and be taught English. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan had also campaigned for learning English in 1870s.
The main reason of introducing English in British India was to educate the local people to serve in the institutions that were established by British rulers, because, recruiting people from England would have been more expensive for them.
He said that Anglicist officers like Francis Warden, Alexander Duff and Charles Trevelyan had written against 'Orientalist' ideas and they had argued that English literatures was an agent of moral control.
Lord William Bentinck's policy was announced on 07 March 1835. It stated: The great object of the British government ought to be the promotion of European literature and science among the natives of India; and that all the funds appropriated for the purpose of education would be best employed on English education alone
Dr Tariq Rehman also talked on the fears that English language would be used for promotion of Christianity in the region. "In 1853 H.H. Wilson said to a select committee of the House of Commons that the Muslims feared that the government wanted to convert people to Christianity," he said.
While talking on Sindh Madressatul Islam University, he said that SMI is also part of history, that it was founded in 1885 for the Muslims of Sindh as an English medium school.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU in his concluding remarks said that Sindhi language has remained much advanced in all the periods of history, but today it faces many problems, that must be redressed. It had also progressed in British rule, while people of Sindh were broadminded and accommodative in those days. "In 1885, when Sindh Madressah was established there were four medium of instructions and that were English, Sindhi, Urdu and Gujrati," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said and added that those people who came to Sindh from other regions such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and other neighbouring countries such as Syeds, Pathans (Duranis) etc. they all adapted Sindh's culture and language, that has benefited the province and also to the country. "There is a need to promote all languages of the country, which are under threat today," Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh concluded.

Also, the committee will see the provision of starting programs of Environmental Management or Green Management.
The vice chancellor further said that SMIU is also thinking to add those departments into the university which are most needed for the development of the country. Apart from it, syllabus which is being taught at SMIU will also be reviewed and will be made according to the world standard.

In the meeting it was decided that each department will organize at least one departmental seminar during a semester where students will present their research papers and reports.
It was also decided that SMIU's TV and Radio studios, which are currently working independently, would be made part of Department of Media Studies. In the meeting it was decided that training courses will also be started for working journalists.

He was anti colonial nationalist. She said this great man must be honored.
Prof. Ayesha Jalal said that since last almost 70 years, there is still a debate in Pakistan that we should have democracy or dictatorship and or secular state or religious state.
She was of the view that Mr. Jinnah was firm believer of constitution, rule of law and federation with legitimate rights to the federating units. Mr. Jinnah expressed his clear vision in his speech delivered in the Constitutional Assembly on 11th August 1947 about the Pakistan's future status.

Talking about Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi she said that he most actively played his political role up to 1920s.
Earlier, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU in his welcome speech thanked the guest speaker Prof. Ayesha Jalal and said that she is one of the great historians of our time with reference of her historic work on Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/ayesha-Jalal03.jpg>)
Talking on Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that although he was not belonging to an affluent class, living in 2 bed apartment along with his nine member family in Wazir Mansion, but got his prominent place in the politics of subcontinent through his sheer struggle and wisdom. "At that time there were many prominent leaders in Bengal, Punjab, Bombay and other parts of undivided India, but Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who belonged to a small province of Sindh and a minority community of Agha Khani, became sole spokesman of rights of Muslims in subcontinent. It proves his honesty, leadership qualities and political consciousness," Dr Shaikh said and added that today, the country needs to act upon the ideals of the founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and that is the only way to bring the country on the path of progress and development.
The lecture program was attended by dignitaries, diplomats, prominent academicians and Deans, chairperson, senior faculty, staff members and students of SMIU. On this occasion Prof. Ayesha Jalal also visited Jinnah Museum along with Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh and other guests.

## "Pakistan was created by the provinces" says Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani
18 December 2016

Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani has said that in case of Pakistan, they were the provinces who created it. This he said while delivering his talk under the title "Pakistan at 70: Devolution and Democracy" at the inner courtyard of the historic Main Building of Sindh Madressatul Islam University, last evening.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/SMIU-Dr-Muhammad-Ali-Shaikh.jpg>)
He said the provincial assemblies of Sindh and the Punjab opt for Pakistan using their democratic right of vote. He said the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, then known as Sarhad province, decided to opt for Pakistan through a referendum, while Baluchistan also joined the federation through 'Maslahati Commission.' Hence, the federation of Pakistan was created by the provinces, giving a part of their authority to the federation.
He said Quaid-e-Azam had been an ardent supporter of provincial autonomy throughout his political career. The stance of the All India Muslim League under Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had been in favour of granting the provinces more autonomy in undivided India.
Speaking about separation of East Pakistan, he said that it was a matter of record that the first ever privilege motion moved in newly created assemblies of Pakistan related to a question that why the language of the majority of the people of Pakistan (Bengali) was not the national language. He said the seeds of the separation were sowed at that stage.
He said that the youth must know the real account of the history of Pakistan, as they are the future of of the country.
He said we must produce citizens who will go long way and believe in deviation from democratic process which should be fair and for benefit of Pakistan. Emphasizing on democratic education, Mian Raza Rabbani said our young generation needs to be able to put questions to their government and the parliament.
He said the parliamentary form of government and provincial autonomy are two pivotal points to make Pakistan stronger and prosperous. He was of the view that denying the provinces their rights and denying the people of their language would weaken the country.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/chairman-senate-mian-raza-rabbani01.jpg>)
Chairman Senate said that despite of many failures he is very hopeful about the future of Pakistan through democracy. "In the present democratic era, there are number of issues of governance and weak systems, but I still believe that democracy is better than any other form of government." He further added that the cure of the ills of democracy lied in more democracy and said that the democratic process would eliminate the corruption and other demerits in due course of time.
In his address Vice Chancellor SMIU Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that the latest research suggests that the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) in Pakistan was possibly the earliest cradle and model of democracy in the world. He said amongst the four contemporary civilizations of IVC, the Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley, Anatolia and China, the pervasive influence of an imperial authority could be felt. But, the Indus Valley was different as there is no trace of grandiose structures acting as centers of authority such as forts, palaces or great temples.
He said that the evidence behind this assertion has been the city plans of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, where all the houses irrespective of the social status of the residents had a standard layout and size, and only special structures, possibly public buildings, had been treated differently in the city plan.
He said that many historians believed that this type of civic controls and an organizational system could only have stemmed from some kind of "rule by the people" that was exercised in some Greek city-states some two thousand years later. He said in view of this many scholars have been asking: "Did Greece give birth to democracy, or did Greece simply follow a practice developed earlier?"
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/smiu-staff-faculty.jpg>)
He said that the Indus Valley script has not yet been deciphered, which is a handicap to attempts to draw any final conclusions.
He said that the democracy was in the genes of the people of Pakistan, being the heir to Indus Valley Civilization. However, he said the invasions and foreign rule had suppressed the longing for democracy to some extent but the desire had not died down.
Earlier, the Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani visited the Jinnah Museum of SMIU and showed keen interest in relics and academic credentials of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other old students. He also saw the old record of SMIU preserved at the museum.
The program was also attended by foreign diplomats, eminent educationists, students and faculty members.

## SMIU organizes lecture of Mr. Mahmood Shaam on "Future of Print Media in Digital Era"
24 October 2016

Prominent journalist of Pakistan Mr. Mahmood Shaam has said that although print media has no big threat in the age of Digital Media, but it must bring basic changes in its reporting, display of news and layout.
Delivering lecture on "Future of Print Media in Digital Era", organized by Department of Media Studies of Sindh Madressatul Islam University, at Junagarh Hall of the university on Monday, the veteran journalist said that despite electronic and social media, the print media is still stable and popular specially in Pakistan, He said today the major weakness of newspapers is that they have launched their own channels also. This is why, the owners of newspapers are giving less attention to their newspapers and also less investing in them. "The newspapers are paying low salaries to their journalists in comparison with the journalists working in their television channels," he said.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/mahmood-shaam01.jpg>)
He further said that according to some sources, today in Pakistan circulation of Urdu and English newspapers is 12 million copies, viewers of television channels is 60 million, users of internet are 34 million and mobile phone users are 130 million.
Mr. Mahmood Shaam said if newspapers are shaped according to the needs of 21 st century, then there is a future for them, but today majority of newspapers are being published on the pattern of 1980s. The only change in the newspapers is that they are now being published on computer instead of calligraphy.
He further said that the timing of editorial writing should also be changed. In the past main source of the event for editorial writing was only newspapers, this is why editorial was written in morning, but today due to electronic, digital sand social media, news of any major event remains not fresh, therefore editorial should be written just before finalizing the copy.
Mr. Mahmood Shaam also said newspapers should not publish news of high government officials including prime minister, chief ministers etc. as the lead news, because people have already listened such news on the channels in the day, therefore, their own exclusive news or like the newspapers of the West, education, health and the news related to problems of masses should be made the lead news.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/mahmood-shaam02.jpg>)
He also said channels are spreading confusion up to 11:00 pm daily, therefore, newspapers should need to clear such confusion in their next edition.
Mr. Mahmood Shaam further said that Sindh Madressatul Islam University and other universities can play a historic role in such situation. He said ideologies are getting birth in the universities. This is why, universities can train the future journalists of the country very well. He said SMIU can also give a charter about the newspapers of 21 st century, politics, economy and about the society to Pakistan.
He praised the role of Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU for converting SMIU into the modern university.
Earlier, Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University in his speech eulogizing the great role of Mr. Mahmood Shaam played in journalism in Pakistan said that Mr. Mahmood Shah has given about a half century of his life to journalism in the country. Now he himself has become an institution.
He said that Mr. Mahmood Shaam is among those journalists who are not only journalists, but they are working on the idea to bring social change in the society. Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh said education and journalism are un-separable subjects, but the young generation has lost their interest in book and newspaper reading. Despite that fact print media in Pakistan still occupies its space.
The question- answer session was also held on the occasion.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh also gave souvenirs to the guest. Before the lecture Mr. Mahmood Shaam also visited Jinnah Museum of SMIU

In his presidential address Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that today Manchhar Lake is facing a great threat due to toxic materials of industries dropping into it through Right Bank Out Fall Drainage (RBOD) and from domestic wastages. He said that SMIU's researchers are working on the issue of contaminated water of Manchhar Lake. And in today's world the Magnetic Technology is being used for purification of water. So, in this regard SMIU will initiate experimental work in its Malir Campus by using Magnetic Technology on the small level. And after finding satisfactory results of it, then the Government of Sindh will be suggested to use the same technology for the purpose at Manchhar Lake.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh while talking on the presentation about law and order situation in Karachi's two areas like Lyari and Kati Pahari, said that we need concrete evidence of effects of law and order situation on education of the city. He suggested that the entire city should be divided into three categories like localities of poor people, middle class and affluent class. By these different spectrums we can draw a complete picture of affects of law and order situation on education and students of the city.
Similarly, he said that we have also included other parts of the city in the research study on pollution. He suggested that the researcher should conduct study on air and noise pollution separately. Talking on the career in education, Dr Shaikh said that it is also a problem of the entire country that the competent persons are not willing to join field of education as a profession. Therefore, de-motivating factors behind career choice in education field should be found through research study. The session was attended Dean and other senior faculty members.

"China and Pakistan Should collaborate to address those issues; and here comes the role of researchers to help those engaged in development process," said Dr Shaikh and added that communication gap between the two countries could be removed by learning of national and regional languages of China and Pakistan.
Dr Khalid Amin, head of International Cooperation, Institute of Business Management (IoBM) called for investment in applied research, which could contribute in wellbeing of the society, as, he said, the developing world, Islamic nations in particular, were miserably lacking in that field.
He said the combined GDP of all the Islamic nations, 57 to be precise, was less than a single developed nation like the United Kingdom and Germany of Europe. He said superior technological knowledge played important role in the development of nations.
Giving the state of affairs vis-à-vis research in the developing countries, he said, 95% of that research was purely for academic consumption, which largely remained unutilized and had little relevance to the society.
"We need to rely on applied research," he said, adding his institution had research ties with at least 60 universities of various countries. Jointly, he said, those universities were engaged in meaningful research that could be used for the sake of development of the society.
He suggested that there was need to produce graduates who were tailor-made to be used in China and Pakistan for conducting applied research. "There should be combined research that could be used for the corporate world."
Dr Razia Sultana, vice chancellor of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University, Peshawar, said the universities' forum would provide a representative platform for joint research ventures in innovative manner especially that interested the two countries.
She said China was a global power and its economy was destined to top the world by 2018, and it was in the interest of Pakistan's universities to get benefit of the success story of the friendly neighbor and set in motion joint research projects with its counterparts across the border.
"We should learn from each other's experience as China has been helping us attain lasting economic stability in our country."
Prof Yang Ziju, vice president of Hainan Tropical Ocean University and Ms. Li Huiyan of Sanya University, also spoke on the occasion.
Dr Mazharul Haq Siddiqui, ex-VC of the Sindh University while addressing the session held on Prospectus and mechanism for faculty and students exchange programme, said Sindh's liberal mindset had no conflict with the Chinese socialist culture. He said both countries had creative and hardworking people who would be panacea to kill all the ills, whatsoever.
Prof Chen Zuocong, vice dean, school of computer engineering, Hainan Tropical Ocean University, Xuebing ling of Hainan University, Dr Abdul Razzaq Sabir, vice chancellor, University of Turbat and Dr KB Mirbahar, VC of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University Sakrand, also spoke on the occasion.
At the conclusion of the Sindh Hainan Universities Forum representatives of Pakistan's 13 universities signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with four universities of China's Hainan province.
Under the MoUs the universities of the two countries agreed to cooperate with each other in future research-oriented and student and faculty exchange programmes.

## 3- Day "Sindh- Hainan Universities Forum" started
02 May 2016
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/sindh-hainan-universities-forum-started.jpg>)
KARACHI: Chairman Senate, Mian Raza Rabbani, on Monday said collaboration between the universities of Sindh and Chinese province of Hainan was a 'healthy departure' by Pakistan from the old policy of looking towards educational institutions in Europe and United States, and that 'education corridor' would play a role in forging unity among the nations in Asia.
He said there should be a link between the universities of Pakistan and the country's parliament as being practiced elsewhere in the world, which would help the parliamentarians to devise concrete and reality-based policies in light of the guidance and advice of the scholars in universities.
The Senate chairman was speaking as the chief guest at the opening session of the Sindh-Hainan Universities Forum under China-Pakistan Partnership organized by the Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) at Hotel Marriott.
With the advent of the three-day Forum, affiliation of the SMIU with four universities in Hainan was formally announced. According to the agreement, the universities would offer admission to the two countries, and SMIU initially will its 20 students to China for short period.
Mr Rabbani spoke over the historic background of the Sino-Pakistan relationship. He said former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Chairman Mao forged friendship, which strengthened with the passage of time.
"We, the people of Asia, share many things in common in our rich history and tremendous future, and initiatives like this will help us a long way to forge inseparable Asian unity," said Mr Raza Rabbani.
He said Sindh and Hainan had many things in common - from geography and historic events to the fact that both - communism in the Chinese province and Sufism of Sindh - fight against autocracy.
"This education corridor launched by the two provinces of the sisterly nations will bring prosperity for both the countries and create economic fortunes that will benefit the generations to come," he said.
He said China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would cement relationship between the two countries and improve Pakistan's ability to defend its soil more efficiently.
He called on for 'academic freedom' and reinforcement of intellectual discourse in the country as, according to him, it would offer better prospects and shining future and help the parliament come about with reality-based solutions to all sorts of challenges Pakistan faced.
"The government should encourage academic discourse in universities and parliament should benefit from the intellect of scholars in universities in its proceedings and future legislation," he said.
He said dominant bourgeois stopped debate in universities to perpetuate their rule, which should be restored now.
He said Senate had signed memorandums of understanding (MoU) with eight leading universities of Pakistan, under which they would sent interns to the upper house. In fact, he added, some of those interns were already working in the senate.
Similarly, Mr Rabbani said, a MoU had been signed with the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) in under which they would provide the senate intellectual pool to help members and standing committee devising concrete and reality-based opinions.
He said it was high time to ensure autonomy of universities as they were the only forums that could help exposing best talent in Pakistan to the world and make the country one of the leading academic nations in the world.
He lauded Vice Chancellor, SMIU, Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh, for looking to Asia instead of the West as most generally did.
Earlier, Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh traced back the civilizational past of Pakistan and China, which was as ancient as 5,000 years. He said both the countries had trade relations for millennia. He said universities were leading the world and effectively engines that offered advancements to the world.
He said formal contact between universities of the two countries materialized last year when a Chinese delegation visited Sindh and was reciprocated by a Pakistani delegation headed by him to China.
He said vice chancellors of 13 universities of Sindh were taking part in the conference, which would provide opportunity to them to have direct contact with 10 Chinese delegates from four universities of Hainan and strengthen the relationship further.
Acting consul general of the Chinese Mission in Mu Yong Ceng, hoped that this forum would open up new avenues in the field of education.
Prof Lu Dan, president of Sanya University, said cooperation between the two provinces in the field of education was the only way to gain prosperity for which he gave example of China's development that it achieved in one-third time compared to other nations.
Justice (retired) Syed Deedar Hussain Shah and MNA Ghous Bux Maher, members of SMIU syndicate, also spoke on the occasion.

## Second Day of SMIU Spring Festival 2016 Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh talked on "Pakistan: A Modern Country - Contrast Between Jinnah's and Today's Pakistan"
08 March 2016
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/second-day-of-smiu-spring-festival-2016.jpg>)
The Literary Society of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) organized a talk on "Pakistan: A Modern Country - Contrast Between Jinnah's and Today's Pakistan" by Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMIU on the second day (Tuesday) of Spring Festival at the premises of the university.
In his thought provoking talk Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh elaborated the ideals of Founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah for Pakistan in detail. In this respect he highlighted the rights and role of women, minorities, poor people, youth, government officers and Pakistan's relations with other countries including India with reference to Quaid-e- Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's speeches delivered on different occasions.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that 8th March was being celebrated as International Women's Day, therefore he preferred to revisit the thoughts of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah on women. He said that the Quaid had fully favoured equal rights and respect to women. Giving reference of the Quaid's speech delivered on 10 March 1944 at a meeting of the Muslim University Union, Aligarh, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said the Quaid had said that, "no nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are not side by side with you. We are victims of evil customs. It is crime against humanity that our women are the shut up within the four walls of houses."
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that we have failed to honour the Quaid's ideals about women. Even today, women are being subjugated in various forms include karo kari and vata sata,
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that only a tiny size of our women population has gotten importance in the society and jobs and some positions in public and private organizations, while a majority of women is still deprived of their basic civil, human and educational rights.
Talking on the status of non Muslims living in Pakistan he said that the Quaid had assured them for their protection and rights as the equal citizens of Pakistan, but, even today, we have not succeeded to act upon the thoughts of Father of the Nation.
Similarly, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that the Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was clear on the status of poor people of Pakistan. In his speech delivered at the meeting of Muslim League Workers at Calcutta on 1st March 1946, he had said that "I am an old man. God has given me enough to live comfortably at this age. Why would I turn my blood into water, run about and take so much trouble? Not for the capitalists surely, but for you, the poor people."
"Today poverty is on rise in the country, while rich man is becoming richer. That is again against the poor people, for whom the Quaid had founded this country," Dr Shaikh said.
Talking about youth of the country Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh was of the opinion that our young generation must achieve their education rather than to engage themselves in unhealthy activities. He also said that the Quaid had wanted cordial and friendly relations with the international community including India, but this situation has not fully improved today.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh in his concluding remarks said that we can make our country prosperous and developed only by following and working on ideals of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He also gave answers of some questions asked by the students. On the occasion Prof. Dr. Aurangzeb, Dean of Department of Business Administration presented a shield to Dr. Muhammad Ali Shaikh.
On the other side, festivities remained continued on the second day of the 3- Day Spring Festival at SMIU. A huge number of students were witnessed on the stalls setup by the students' societies. Also a lecture on Emotional Quotient, mystic music, singing competition, declamation contest on Resilient Women of Pakistan and short film awards, were held.
Students of SMIU, who have organized this three day festival through their elected Student Societies, were actively participating in all the programmes. The Vice Chancellor Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh also appreciated their enthusiasm and organizational skills.

A number of sports events are also part of the Spring Festival. In a simple ceremony the Wing Commander of Pakistan Rangers Sindh lieutenant Colonel Shahid said that it was the honour and his personal privilege to visit the Alma Matter of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. He said we were reading and listening about this place as an Alma Mater of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah since our childhood, but today he feels proud by seeing the institution.
He further said that the atmosphere and quality of education being provided to the students at SMIU is the best thing. Sindh Madressatul Islam University is also a good institution than other institutions of the country in cleanliness and organisation.

Mr. Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, Sindh's Minister for Education and Literacy has said that higher education was necessary for nation's progress and development. Hence, more universities should be opened in the country, especially in Sindh, where only 50 universities working in public and private sector, can't fulfill needs of huge population of the province. He said this while addressing inaugural session of "National Seminar on Higher Education in Pakistan: The Way Forward," which was organized by Sindh Madressatul Islam University at a local hotel on Friday, October 16, 2015.

Mr. Nisar Ahmed Khuhro said that we were not in favour of mushroom growth of universities in public and private sector, but there was a need of quality universities in Pakistan and Sindh province. The provincial education minister while emphasizing on merit based selection of students and faculty, said that we must concentrate on research. The distance learning was also a one way for getting education that should not be discouraged. He also said that after passage of 18th amendment the provinces were allowed to establish their own Higher Education Commissions, and now Sindh has its fully functional Higher Education Commission. He further said that our universities need funding, quality, encouragement and good faculty and students.
Mr. Khuhro said that Pakistan was doing well in education sector, but when we compare our universities with the universities of other countries, we feel that we must move forward in this respect. He said that there were more opportunities of higher education in Pakistan; hence we have to concentrate on quality of higher education in the country.

He also congratulated Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University on organizing this more important seminar.
Ms. Sharmila Farooqui, Special Assistant to Chief Minister Sindh said that Pakistan was confronting with an issue of quality of higher education. Hence, there should be merit based selection of faculty and students. She said that the enough funds should be allocated for scholarships for students. Also endowment fund should be set up for research work by faculty. She said that there was a continuous need of reviewing our syllabus. She also said that SMIU must open its campuses in other cities of Sindh like Sukkur, Larkana and other cities to provide quality education to poor students, who could not come to Karachi.
Mr. Mazharul Haq Siddiqui, former Vice Chancellor of University of Sindh said that human resources are very important for development of any country, while higher education is equally important for any nation's progress. He said that we must give importance to our primary education, thereafter, higher education could be improved. He said we were far below in investment in education sector and that was only 2 percent, hence education budget must be increased and more universities be opened specially in rural areas of Sindh, as almost all universities were situated in urban areas.
Earlier, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University in his welcome address extended his deepest gratitude to the guests especially vice chancellors who came from other provinces of Pakistan. He said that main objective of holding this seminar was to discuss the issues related to universities and higher education in Pakistan and find ways to move forward. He said that this was a first seminar of its kind that SMIU has organized in the country. Dr Shaikh said that we must think on it why majority of our universities was not generating good results. He said that there were weaknesses of our higher education system. This is why; only one person - Dr Abdul Salam had received Nobel Prize so far. He said that outdated syllabus and politicization of teachers and students were among the problems facing universities. Hence, we must focus on quality of our higher education.

15 September 2015
Mr. Fazlullah Pechuho, Secretary Education and Literacy Department, Government of Sindh has said that the Education Department has taken revolutionary steps for improvement in education system in Sindh by introducing Biometric System and separation of management cadre from education cadre as teaching staff can't mange education system properly.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/fazalullah-pechuho.jpg> "Mr. Fazlullah Pechuho, Secretary Education and Literacy Department")
He said this while delivering lecture on "State of Education in Sindh" on Tuesday at Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU).
Mentioning changes brought in the department Mr. Fazlullah Pechuho said that the Sindh Education Department has enrolled a large number of teaching and non teaching staff members through Biometric System, while more than 2200 Monitors for teachers' attendance are being hired to ensure attendance of teachers in schools. In addition to it, the Sindh Education Department is also working on scanning and archiving one hundred and fifty thousand files of employees of the department aimed at digitalizing official record. He further said that a mobile complaint system has also introduced, that can be helpful in improvement of education system.
Mr. Pechuho said that 2000 head masters are also being recruited on merit basis. "In the last three years no single teacher has been recruited on chit, and all the 15000 teachers have been recruited through NTS system and the donors had too testified their merit," Mr. Pechuho said.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/vc-smiu-mali.jpg> "Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University")
He said that the Sindh government is spending 15000 to 18000 rupees per child enrolled in a public sector school, annually, but the private schools are spending approximately 900 rupees per child, while there is no difference in quality of education in both the private and public sector primary schools. Private schools also pay less than 50 percent salaries to their teachers than the teachers of public sector schools. Hence the private schools should increase salaries of teachers, not fees of students.
He also said that the USAID is spending a huge amount on education in Sindh and 120 most modern schools are also being established in Sindh, which will be run through Education Management System. He said that for this management system Rs500million have been allocated. The Sindh Education Secretary said that curriculum is also being reviewed. After 18th Amendment, the Government of Sindh has established its Curriculum Wing, which earlier was a federal subject.
Mr. Pechuho said English language is essential for individual as well as national progress and Urdu, Sindhi and other languages should also be taught. "In today's global village we can't live in isolation," he said and added that people should own schools of their respective areas as our ancesters were doing in the past. In such a way we can improve our education system.

The Education Secretary also visited Jinnah Museums and other sections of SMIU.
## Vice Chancellors of Sindh Madressatul Islam University and Allama Iqbal Open University agreed on mutual cooperation between two universities

Dr Shahid Siddiqui, Vice Chancellor of Allama Iqbal Open University, Islamabad (AIOU) has said that AIQU and Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) will cooperate with each other in the field of education and research and will share their resources for cause of quality education in the country.
Addressing the faculty members of SMIU at Junagarh Hall of the university on Monday, the Vice Chancellor of AIOU said that it was his first visit to SMIU, which has a historic significance being an Alma Mater of founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. "I felt proud while passing through the corridors, where the Quaid had walked during his period of study over here. Even the faculty of SMIU is also privileged as it was serving here," Vice Chancellor of AIOU commented.
He further said that AIOU was publishing eight research journals, hence, SMIU faculty can also contribute their research works. He said that if the research work can't benefit our society and under privileged people, then it has no importance.
Praising the role of Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor SMIU played for development of the institution, the Vice Chancellor of AIOU Dr Shahid Siddiqui said that Dr Shaikh has performed a marvelous role by elevating a school to the level of university. He has great leadership qualities and he always thinks about progress and development of SMIU and its contacts with national and international universities.
Talking about literacy rate in the country, Dr Shahid Siddiqui said at the time of Independence, there was only 19 percent literacy rate in Pakistan, now it has reached to 60 percent. Despite that we have to spread education even to the down trodden classes and remote areas of the country.
He said that AIOU is imparting education to 1.3 million students all over the country and it was a great vision of Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who introduced distance learning in 1974 by establishing AIOU, while the world is coming to the same idea of distance learning now. He said that the main objective of AIOU is to provide quality education to financially poor students on their door steps.
Earlier, Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor SMIU said that the cooperation between SMIU and AIOU is pertinent for quality education in the country. He said that among these two institutions one carries name of Allama Muhammad Iqbal and other university is an Alma Mater of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, hence these two universities must come closer to each other, which will be a great national service.
On the occasion, a Question-Answer session also held. Prior to it, Mr. Shahid Siddiqui visited Jinnah Museum, TV and FM Radio Stations of SMIU and other sections and appreciated the administration of SMIU for providing such modern supporting facilities to its students.

Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University while welcoming Mr. Kamaluddin Tipu at SMIU said that there was only one channel in Pakistan before 2002, but after it, an independent media emerged, that benefited almost all sections of society. "Prior to the private electronic media, about half of the population of the country, being illiterate had no access to information and entertainment except Radio Pakistan and PTV," but these channels reached to their door steps with latest information. Such change has created awareness among the masses.
Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh said that despite such big social change there was a problem especially with the electronic media that they had a lack of professionally trained manpower; as a result they couldn't present quality content and uphold ethical and moral values. On the contrary, the print media was so balanced due to its centuries old traditions of balanced journalism.

Then his son Jinnabhai, father of Mr. Jinnah, shifted to Gondal town for business purpose. "When the construction of Suez Canal completed in 1869, Karachi became the closest port of British India to Europe. Through Suez Canal, Karachi became about two hundred nautical miles nearer Bombay from European ports, saving time, money and fuel. Additionally, the route through Sindh provided an easier access to the Punjab, northern India and even Afghanistan. In this backdrop, Karachi's fortunes as a port city were getting an unprecedented boost and Jinnabhai decided to shift to Karachi along with his wife and to establish his business there," Dr Shaikh said.

Mr. Kamran Nasir, CEO, JS Global Capital Limited has said that Sindh Madressatul Islam University has a great history, and it deserves reverence, respect, attention and cooperation of each and every citizen of Pakistan, as founder of the country Quaid-e-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah has received his education from here. His company JS Global is also working in education field; therefore, we shall extend cooperation to Sindh Madressatul Islam University in some areas. He said this during his lecture delivered on "How capital markets work in Pakistan" to the students of Department of Business Administration and Commerce of Sindh Madressatul Islam University on Thursday. This lecture was a part of SMIU's efforts to establish linkages between the university and industries.
Mr. Kamran Nasir said students of the Business Administration and Commerce must learn dynamics and modern trends of economy, finance and capital market, due to that they will become good leaders, businessmen and entrepreneurs in future. He said his company shall welcome to the graduates of SMIU by offering them job opportunities in the company.
Talking on the subject of his lecture "How capital markets work in Pakistan" Mr. Kamran Nasir said since last three years, economy of Pakistan is on right track and improving gradually, which has resulted in improvement of capital market of the country also.
He was of the view that political stability, security and education are key factors for development of Pakistan. He said there is also shortage of economists in the country; hence this subject must be given priority. He further said each and every citizen can become a share holder in the Stock Market with investment of lowest amount, but students must know that their success depend on hard work, dedication and commitment. He was of the opinion that investment in capital market (stock exchange) is better than investment in gold and property.
He said the government is not spending much money on education, but parents with the help of private educational institution are playing important role in the field of education and literacy. Mr. Kamran Nasir said PIA, Pakistan Railways and Pakistan Steels Mills are going in loss of 1.0 billion rupees yearly, that debt is being paid from national exchequer. So, the only solution of this problem is to privatize these companies and save 1.00 billion rupees. "Due to privatization policy, economy of the country is becoming better," he maintained.
He opined that Pakistan is 6th largest global populated country, this is why the consumer companies of the world and investors couldn't ignore it. "Business is a large scope in the country, and successful businessmen are investing their money in the days of panic, but the successful persons are always going opposite to the circumstances and Mr. Jahangir Siddiqui is doing so," he concluded.
Prof. Dr. Rukhsar Ahmed, Dean of Department of Business Administration and Commerce and Prof. Dr. Aurangzeb also spoke on the occasion. The lecture followed by question- answer session.

## National Seminar on Citizen's Right to Information and Social Accountability organized by SMIU
December 15, 2014
Pakistan was the first one in South Asia to embark upon its Journey in the domain of freedom of information by introducing legislation in 1997, but that was a reluctant move and the law, which was inform of an ordinance issued by the President, was allowed to lapse. This was stated by Justice (Retd) Syed Deedar Hussain Shah, former Judge of Supreme Court/Chief Justice, Sindh High Court while addressing. National Seminar on Citizen's Right to Information and Social Accountability organized by Sindh Madressatul Islam University Karachi at a local hotel this evening.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/addressing-citizens-right.jpg> "Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor SMIU addressing the seminar.")
He said that the new government, elected through elections, did not promulgated it or pass it in form of a bill in the parliament and after a lot of inertia and reluctance , another flawed version of the law in form of "Freedom of Information Ordinance" was issued by the President in September 2002 Justice (Retd) Syed Deedar Hussain Shah added that the greatest problem being faced by Pakistan today and during last 67 years of its history has been corruption and with passing every year, the menace of corruption has been constantly increasing. He said that the result of this ever increasing phenomenon has been that, an overwhelmingly large number of development projects financed through Pakistan's National resources as well as international aid have not been able to contribute to the national economy, the purpose for which they were intended for.
Justice (Retd) Deedar Hussain Shah further said that on the contrary, they enhanced the country's international financial obligations due to debt retirement increasing poverty. He said that the state of affairs has largely been due to absence of transparency in public spending, both civil and military, and the remedy to this malady lies in cultivating the culture of openness in the public dealings while the institutional framework for bringing openness and transparency could be introduced through the Citizen's right to Information. He added that it is commendable that the Constitutional protection to the right to Information has been provided; it is high time that Pakistan should frame set of rules for ensuring this right in an efficient and effective manner. He said that it is only through transparency ensured by the Citizen's right to Information that Pakistan society could curb the menace of corruption making it possible to eradicate poverty and embark upon the Journey to the National Development.
Senator Farhatullah Babar in his speech informed that law regarding establishment of Information Commission is under way and the draft law has been placed before legal committee, which will later be placed before Federal Cabinet and hopefully the bill will be enacted after duly endorsed by the Cabinet. He added the matters pertaining to National Security and Military installations have been exempted from such necessity. The information commission will be comprised of Judges, High ranking advocates, eligible to become the Judges. He said that we only make the law but lacks the implementation of the same at all levels, for which there is need of awareness. He added that this is appropriate time to encourage and approve the law and form the required Commission early with spirit of work of the subject. Senator Farhatullah Babar also gave replies to questions of audience and students of the University. He said that freedom of speech, freedom of expression and rights of freedom to information have been made with constitutional need.

## Table Calendar "Jinnah and SMI" launched
The Vice Chancellor Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU) Dr. Mohammad Ali Shaikh launched the Table Calendar-2015 "Jinnah and SMI" published by SMIU here on Tuesday, December 2, 2014. This beautifully designed calendar highlights various aspects of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's association with historic Sindh Madressatul Islam. In addition to narrations relating to the subject, the calendar also carries some of the historic photographs of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah taken at Sindh Madressatul Islam as well as other places.
[](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/all/<http:/100host.com.pk/SMIUv2/news_images/first-table-calendar.JPG> "Table Calendar Jinnah and SMI launched")
The twelve leaves of the calendar representing each month highlight different aspects of Mr. Jinnah's association with SMI where he spent the longest spell of his academic life, from 1887 to 1892. The themes highlighted in the calendar relates to his years of education; his reverence and respect for the founder of the institution, Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi; his deep sentiments about his alma-mater as well as his last will, wherein he bequeathed one third of his personal property to Sindh Madressatul Islam.
The calendar also highlights the fact that Quaid-e-Azam got his command over English language during his studies at SMI, where he learnt the language under the tutelage of Mr. H.P. Jacob who served as Educational Inspector in Sindh at that time but took personal interest in proficiency of students in English. One of the leaves also highlights that Quaid-e-Azam might got introduced to Shakespeare's poetry at SMI. It also bring to the fore the notion that the institution provided top quality education to Mr. Jinnah, which is evident from the fact that even without appearing in matriculation examination Mr. Jinnah was able to clear the Lincoln's Inn's entrance examination in London, which got him admission in the Inn.
The calendar also highlights that the first contact of Mr. Jinnah with the highest ranking British officials might have been taken place at SMI, which was visited by the Viceroy of India, the Governor of Bombay and other senior British Officers on different occasion during the period of Mr. Jinnah's study. One leaf of the calendar highlights that during the period of Jinnah's studies at SMI, he was subjected to living in a multicultural environment, where students and faculty belonging to various religious communities like Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Jews studied and worked together. It suggests that Mr. Jinnah's famous speech of 11th August 1947 in the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan might have basis in the multicultural environment prevailing at SMI.
It may be pointed out that "Mohammadally Jinnabhoy," as Quaid-e-Azam was known in his early life, was enrolled at Sindh Madressatul Islam in July 1887 and studied there till January 1892, with two brief intervals. Quaid-e-Azam revered his Alma Mater to the extent that he upgraded it to college from school in 1943 and bequeathed one-third of his personal property to it through his last will.
It may be noted that SMI is one of the oldest institutions in South Asia, which was established as a school in 1885 by Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi. It was upgraded to college by Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah in 1943 and was elevated to University in 2012. At present it offers graduate and undergraduate programs in Media Studies, Computer Science, Business Administration, Environmental Sciences and Education. It is known for its high quality of education and research.
The excerpts and quotations given in the calendar are taken from the book "Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah: Education, Struggle and Achievements" written by Dr. Mohammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor SMIU and published by SMI University Press in 2014.

Thereafter, in his speech he said that during the last 67 years of the independence, the country has progressed in many areas, which was impossible for Muslims in undivided India. Besides, with creation of Pakistan, Muslim nation preserved their national identity, cultural values and fundamental rights. "Now we are free to perform our religious rituals, celebrate our cultural day and move ahead," he said.
Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh further said Pakistan had received only one public sector university on the day of Independence, and that was Punjab University, where only 644 students were enrolled, but now 150 universities are working in the country, out which 75 are public sector universities and 75 are private sector universities, where one million students are getting higher education.
He maintained that before Partition of Indo Pak subcontinent there was 75 percent population of Muslims in Sindh, but only 22 percent Muslims were in public sector jobs. Hence, there was a big difference between Muslims and Hindus in almost all areas of life. This is why, Muslims united under one flag of Pakistan under the dynamic leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. He also said that it was the ground of Sindh Madressatul Islam, from where the central leadership of Pakistan like Quaid –e- Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Sir Abdullah Haroon, Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, Khan Bahadur Mohammad Ayub Khuhro, Ghulam Mohammad Bhurgri and others emerged and they ultimately achieved a separate state for Muslim.
Dr Shaikh said that there is no doubt that the country is facing challenges of law and order situation, terrorism, corruption and other problems, but we have to critically review our performance today - on the Independence day, which is also a day of accountability for us and then must think and work for betterment of the country and its people.
Later on cake cutting ceremony was also held. Senior management, faculty and staff members attended the flag hoisting ceremony. In the end sweets were distributed among the participants.

Proceedings of the program started with recitation from Holy Quran. Then the president of Rotary Club Mr. Saifuddin Bandooqwala, who also happens to be an old student of SMI, presented introduction of Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh.
Afterwards while delivering the lecture on "Higher Education in Pakistan" Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh said that before creation of Pakistan there was only one Public Sector University in the present day provinces of Pakistan and that was Lahore University. Now there are 150 public sector universities in the country, but generally; the research work is lacking in these all universities. Except a few private sector universities, the rest universities are catering traditional education especially in business administration and IT, but there is no valuable research work is being carried out by faculty and students.
Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh while mentioning the problems facing specially public sector universities in the country said students politics have negatively affected academic atmosphere of public sector universities. Therefore, to counter the militant wings of political parties, another force like Rangers has been deployed in the campuses.
Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh further said political interference in selection of faculty is also a main reason of poor performance of public sector universities. "Now autonomous status of public sector universities have been remained no more as main officials of the universities such as vice chancellor, registrar, director finance and controller of examination are being appointed by Sindh Governor on advice of Chief Minister of Sindh," Dr Shaikh said and added that about 34 billion rupees are being given to public sector universities annually, which amount although is less than annual budget of foreign universities, but it is being not utilized properly. He said 6 times less amount is being given to colleges in Sindh as compared to the universities; this is why the performance of colleges is also very poor. "Colleges are most ignored sector of education in our country," he said.
Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh has said before the Partition of Indo-Pak Subcontinent, the British government of India had given autonomy to public sector universities, but later it was snatched from them by interference of politicians and bureaucracy. Now public sector universities are facing big problem of good governance and fair utilization of funds.
The vice chancellor of SMI University also talked on the history of Sindh Madressatul Islam University and its present day situation."SMI University besides opening Department of Business Administration and Computer Science, three departments of public service as the Department of Education, Environmental Sciences and Media Studies have been opened," Vice Chancellor of SMI University said and added that the private sector universities are concentrating only on two departments as Business Administration and Computer Science, as these universities mostly have been established by businessmen.
Concluding his lecture Dr. Mohammad Ali Shaikh said the higher education in Pakistan is passing through an evolution phase; hence he is optimist that the future politicians and rulers would realize the importance of the higher education and will improve it according to the world standard. He also suggested that that modern facilities and conducive atmosphere should provide to the students as they could get better education with peace of mind.
A large number of members of the club including Sardar Yaseen Malik attended it.

## 2nd International Seminar on "Sindh Through the Centuries"(Day-1)
## Inaugural Session
March 24, 2014
Opposition Leader in National Assembly of Pakistan, Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah on Monday, March 24, 2014 underlined the need of more research on Indus Valley and transferring the knowledge to the people.
"There are several aspects of history of Indus Valley, which are yet to be explored," he said adding that ambiguity still exists about Rani Kot located in Khirthar Mountain range as to who built it. Similarly history of Kotdiji too needs to be researched, he said in his presidential address at inaugural ceremony of Second International Conference on 'Sindh through the Centuries' organized by Sindh Madressatul Islam University at Marriott hotel.
He also drew attention of historians to the distortion of Sindh history and cited example of birthplace of Father of Nation Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah who was born at Jhirrak town of Thatta district but the textbooks of present day contain lessons that he was born in Karachi. "We must get rid of complex and proudly tell the world real facts about it." He said Sindh is proud having given birth to great leaders of international repute like Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto.
Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah said Sindh is land of Sufis and the people of this land embraced Islam only because of their influence and not through the sword. He however said the immigrants who used to came here in different periods of history prevailed over Sindhis. Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah called for protecting the Sindhi language and added that he was addressing the seminar in Sindhi language as it was about history of Sindh. He lamented that 70 percent people of Sindh were still illiterate, as children use to study at such schools where the teachers remain absent.
Opposition leader proudly said Sindh was intact while Kashmir is divided in Pakistan and India, Gilgit-Baltistan is part of Pakistan, Iran and India. Similarly, he added, the Punjab is also divided into two parts, one in India and other in Pakistan while Balochistan is divided between Pakistan and Iran.
Leader of Opposition in Senate Senator Aitzaz Ahsan speaking as chief guest said Sindh of today is a society of migrants as most of the people from Syeds of Saudi Arabia to Urdu speaking from India came and settled here. It is the land of the Sindh that embarraced everyone of them. "Sindh is distinct in its exclusiveness, as it embraced all the immigrants." Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan told his frequent visits to Mohen Jo Daro since early seventies and said he was impressed by the civic system of ancient city. "We can see the present cities like Lahore, Faisalabad and other cities which have turned into heaps of garbage. Briefly tracing the history of kings and kingdoms, Mr Aitzaz Ahsan said according his findings there were no kings in that period of history and only the priests used to govern. "I wrote a chapter in my book titled 'Priests of Mohenjo Daro.'" He called for more and more research on Indus Valley history.
In her keynote address renowned historian Dr. Hamida Khuhro also called for more research saying 'we have not been able to identify many urban settlements and cities mentioned by historians and travelers. She gave example of Ibn Battuta who mentions the city of Janani which he describes as large fine city on the banks of Indus River with splendid markets. "Also not much work has been done on the social and economic history of the entire period from pre-Muslim times to the colonial period and this is in an unlimited field for research. No serious student of Sindh and researcher will be short of subjects. This vast field of study also includes the much neglected subject of Sindh anthropology," she said.
Dr. Hamida Khuhro said this region is home to a large number of marginalized communities that are very important to the economy of Sindh through the ages and performed skilled tasks. "For instance the Oads who expertise in mud construction that can well compete the cement and concrete. Mohanas or Mirbahars who plied the Indus in boats are oldest of our communities but are referred as Punjabis in upper Sindh. May be some study can explain why or how?" She said Sindh is suffering from downside of globalization-environmental degradation from pollution, destruction of local habitats, excessive flooding from global warming, salinity and degradation of fertile land and so on. She also referred to floods of 2010 and 2011 that hit the economy of Sindh due to destruction of crops, houses etc. She said 'We need to have more research to show how to prevent environmental degradation." "Many inexpert attempts at preservation have had disastrous effects on the irreplaceable monuments and there is need not only of awareness but of expertise and dedication in the work of restoration", she said. For instance, she added, use of substandard materials for the new tile work that are being used to replace the old, are destroying the beauty and durability of the historic buildings as indeed is the use of concrete instead of age old mixtures of lime plasters the recipes for which can even now be found among the old practitioners of the art.
Earlier, Vice Chancellor of the SMI University, Dr. Mohammad Ali Shaikh welcomed the foreign delegates and participants. He informed the participants how he and Dr. Hamida Khuhro worked on idea of organizing second international conference on history of Sindh after a gap of 39 years. He said that first such conference was held in March 1975 under the patronage of former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. According to him it was first opportunity that a large number of scholars from different countries had come to talk on Sindh. The conference was held at auditorium of the Habib Bank Plaza and continued for six days.
Talking about theme of the conference he said that Sindh has been cradle of civilization from times immemorial. Its geography helped it develop a peculiar culture. Located between two great ancient civilizations, the South Asian and the Middle Eastern, Sindh enjoyed a degree of islolation throughout its history due to physical barriers on its three sides, a vast desert in the east, an ocean in the south and mountain in ranges in the west. Only in the north it is connected with plains of the Punjab through a bottleneck of the Indus, he added. He said that the Sindh has been destination of several migrations in the history of mankind, mainly due to upheavals taking place beyond its borders. All these factors have afforded Sindh to chart a peculiar course of history and to develop its distinct culture. This seminar focuses on history, culture, language, archeology, anthropology, cusine, arts and crafts of the Sindh.
In the last the speakers were given shields by Dr Muhammmad Ali Shaikh and other guests.
## Technical Session I
Mir Hazar Khan Bijarani, the Sindh Minister for Works and Communication, has urged upon the civil society to follow the path of brotherhood, religious harmony and tolerance preached by Sindh through ancient days for restoring peace and tranquility in the country as well as region. "Religious harmony and tolerance are social assets and identity of Sindh. We should strictly hold it to defeat terrorism and bring peace in our society", he said in his presidential address at first technical session titled 'Sindh: The Cradle of Civilization' at second international conference on 'Sindh through the Centuries.' He said that the Sindh had been a country and not a province in the history having its own identity and prominent culture. Traditionally, he added, Sindhi people were peaceful in the region, but also the warriors at the same time. He hoped that research papers being read at the seminar will be preserved in shape of books, saying that knowledge about history plays vital role in development of nations.
Earlier, US scholar, Jonathan Mark Kenoyer has said that Indus technologies such as metallurgy, ceramics, ornaments, textiles and writing provided a unique window into the socio-economic, ideological and political organization of the early Indus cities during the Harappa Phase of the Indus Tradition.
Kenoyer, who is Professor at Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin, Madison said that study of seals and artifacts from the major sites of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, and Lakhanjodaro, Pakistan and Dholavira and other sites in Gujarat, India provide a new understanding of the complex nature of internal trade between the major regions of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan and Gujarat. He also highlighted new research on sourcing of materials and tracing the movement of raw materials and finished goods within the Indus civilization.
He also looked at major discoveries in adjacent regions that show the extent of trade in goods produced within the Indus Valley and the possible movement of Indus traders and craftsmen to adjacent regions. The areas with the most concrete evidence for Indus trade include Oman and the Gulf, Greater Mesopotamia (Iraq and Iran) and Central Asia. The paper also emphasized the important links between the Indus Tradition and historical period cultures that continue to inhabit the same regions, with a special emphasis on Sindh.
In his research paper, "Between the River and the Desert: The significance of Sindh over millions years of incredible human history, Atsushi Noguchi, researcher at Archeological Investigation Unit, of Meiji University, Tokyo, Japan, said Sindh was the cradle of the Indus civilization in prehistoric times as well as the melting pot of various cultures and ethnic groups. "Sindh keeps its unique position through more than 1.5 million years of incredible human history. Handaxes and cleavers, the oldest form of stone tools, found in the Rohri Hills could be clues of Afro-Asian connection 1.5 million years ago. This shows us the route of the earliest migration of hominids out of Africa into Eurasia", he stated.
Noguchi said another stone tool component from Veesar Valley in the Thar Desert, where our Pakistan-Japan Archaeological Mission is now running a joint research project, has big potential in revealing the history of encounter with and replacement of Archaic Homo by Homo sapiens.
According to him after the Pleistocene Ice Age human beings developed three different types of subsistence economy. In the Thar Desert, new micro-blade technology appeared around the saline Duhbi Lakes at the western fringe of the desert. He maintained that in n Middle Eastern cases, hunter-gatherers with micro-blade technology intensified interaction with herds, learnt controlling and maintaining them, and finally achieved to be the first herders. This probably happened in the Thar Desert in same way.
He said that according to the recent studies, the origin of human adaptation to coastal environment probably appeared in South Africa 100,000 to 70,000 years ago and spread to the Mediterranean region during the Middle to Upper Paleolithic Age. Thus there is the possibility of discovering older evidence of coastal adaptation along the coast of Makran to Karachi In his research paper on 'Indus Valley Heritage Dholavira', Dr. Jetho Lalwani, a retired professor from India said that in the third decade of 20th century, while digging of Mohenjo daro, the discovery of ancient and cultivated civilization of Sindhu Valley motivated the scholars to write a new history of human civilization of the world. The major sites discovered so far are Harappa, Mohenjo daro, Ganeriwala, Rakhigarhi, Kalibangan, Rupnagar, Lothal and Dholavira..
After partition the places where digging has been done are Gujrart's Lothal and Dholvira which are of great importance. During this digging it was found that the towns had been populated in the rectangle are of nearly 48 hectares divided into three parts, this town is the best example of structure. In this town in addition to Rajmahal, the houses too were constructed with planning. Like in Mohenjo Daro high ways, streets, magnificent houses, pakka wells, ponds and drainage facilities in each house etc are seen. Dr. Nilofer Shaikh, former Vice Chancellor, Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur presented her paper 'Sindh: The Millenniums Unraveled'. Her paper focused on unveiling of the earliest levels of prehistory in the above region followed by the settled village cultures, the magnificent Indus Civilization and it's fading away in the early 2nd millennium BCE. According to her the millennium that followed evanesce of the Indus civilization, is still shrouded in mystery.
Mr. Mohammad Rafique Mughal, Professor at Department of Archeology at Boston University, Massachusetts, USA, presented an overview on 'Archaeological Heritage of Sindh from Prehistory to the Islamic times'. He highlighted significant aspects of archaeology of Sindh as revealed through excavations and intensive surveys especially in the post-colonial period since 1947.
## Technical Session - II
Advisor to Sindh Chief Minister for Culture and Tourism Ms. Sharmila Farooqi has said that nations who do not care of their cultural heritage get lost their identity. Protecting the cultural heritage is a great challenge on account of availability and utilization of funds and the government was trying to meet this challenge, she added. She expressed these views while delivering presidential address at second technical session 'Archeological Heritage of Sindh' at first day of the second international conference on 'Sindh through the Centuries.' She said that the Federal government had transferred control of 129 cultural and archeological sites to Sindh in 2011 under devolution of federal subjects. According to her preservation and protection of these sites was a bit challenge for the provincial government especially for want of funds and their utilization. Despite difficulties her department took the job and is trying to do it well, she said adding that people of Sindh are proud of their cultural heritage because it is their identity. "Our identity is our rich cultural heritage and history and not the terrorism and extremism", she added.
Earlier Toshiki Osada, Professor Emeritus of the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, Kyoto, Japan presented his paper. He was head of the team of researchers that painted the fresh image of the Indus civilization through five years of research, known as the Indus Project. "Different regional communities created a loose network through trade", Osada and his team members concluded in their research. He said that two of the more well-known ruins of the Indus civilization are Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, both in Pakistan. Currently, most researchers focus on the ruins of five major urban centers: the two famous sites; Pakistan's Ganeriwala, which is in a desert; India's Dholavira, which is on an island in a marsh; and Rakhigarhi, also in India.
The common view is that the desert sites used to have rivers other than the Indus flowing nearby. Researchers, led by Hideaki Maemoku, a physical geography expert and professor at Japan's Hosei University, examined the area around the desert ruins with a dating method based on mineral crystals. The conclusion is that the cities were built on these dunes only after the river was long gone. Japanese scholar said that at Dholavira, artifacts have been found that suggest thriving maritime trade. The most likely candidates for this trade are the ancient societies in Mesopotamia, which could have been reached via the Arabian Sea. He stated that the Indus Project used computers to plot changes to the coastline over the centuries to figure out where ancient shorelines would have been. Geological features were also studied and changes in terrain were estimated. "All of this found that sea levels were around 2 meters higher and the coastline was much deeper inland. This suggests that many of the ruins in the area were along the ancient shoreline and that this part of the Indus civilization was dependent on the ocean", he opined.
According to him the research has also tried to find out when and why the Indus civilization declined. "When changes in the distribution of ruins are traced using what is called a geographic information system, ruins start to concentrate in northern India at the decline of the civilization", he said, adding that Indus script has yet to be deciphered, which means there is much more to learn. Presenting her paper during the session on recent excavations in Banbhore Dr. Asma Ibrahim, Director, State Bank of Pakistan Museum & Art Gallery Department, said that the site was surveyed completely in 2011; kite-pictures were taken aimed at mapping the site intra moenia, surrounding quarters was carried out.
The next season 2012-13 comprised of excavations and further documentation, results were very interesting and raised many questions, the third season of excavations was 2013-14, Jan –Feb , the results of which are in its preliminary stages but the discoveries are amazing.
Professor Dr. Ghulam Mohiudin Veesar, Department of Archaeology, Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur presented his paper on 'Mesolithic sites in Thar Desert and its implications for human dispersal in Sindh'. He said that the evidence of early, middle and late/upper Paleolithic sites in this region shows that the favorable echo system, raw material and exploitation of natural resources were available for the people of stone-age followed by the prehistoric and post historic settlements that have been systematically documented.
Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Kalhoro, a Research Anthropologist at Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), Islamabad, presented his paper on 'Stupa Images in the Rock art of Sindh'. His paper discusses the Buddhist traditions that are found in the rock art of Sindh.
Ms. Tasleem Alam Abro, who is serving as lecturer at Department of Archaeology, Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur presented her paper on Surface analysis of newly discovered sites in Larkana District'.
## 2nd International Seminar on "Sindh Through the Centuries"(Day-2)
## Technical Session-III-A
March 25, 2014
Renowned German scholar, architect, archeologist, conservationist Prof. of Urban History Mr Micheal Jansen said on Tuesday that the provincial government has approved a project for more research and excavation of Mohen Jo Daro and drilling at different places would soon start to ascertain the depth of remains of ancient city.
In his presentation at technical session III-A held on 'Ancient Art & Architecture of Sindh' he said the archeological site of Mohen Jo Daro is spread over one and half a kilometer but UNESCO is interested in depth of ancient remains.
German scholar was of the view that Indus river course poses threat to Mohen Jo Daro and added that before the banks of Indus River were raised during British rule here in 1870, the river water used to inundate the area eroding the remains.
He did not agree to general perception that the Stupa of Mohen Jo Daro belonged to Buddhist era. "The Buddhist Stupas are generally found far away from the urban areas while the Stupa at Mohen Jo Daro is located in urban area of the ancient city. However, it needs further research," he said.
A study jointly conducted by a South Korean and a Pakistani scholar says there is an illustration of possible linkage between human factor of Manhattan gridiron system (City Plan) and the anthropology of Indus Valley Civilization (Mohen Jo Daro).
Presenting the paper on comparative study on gridiron planning from America to Indus Valley Civilization and pre-Amri period Mehargarh, Balochistan, at the technical session on 'Ancient Art & Architecture of Sindh' on second day of international seminar 'Sindh through the Centuries' at a local hotel on Tuesday, the scholars said archeologists and historians had been requesting the urban planners to systematically design the gridiron due to its after effects in the history. The gridiron once embedded in urban mass is difficult to revise for further change.
The paper, which intended to identify the trends over the time for anthropological living settlement patterns and chronology of compact city plan, says that gridiron pattern is fixing lines and urban frame, a water front line and fixing geometry for defining urban segments. Scholars quoted Stanislawski as saying in 1946 that the origin of the grid (type of city plan in which streets run at right angles to each other forming a grid) was Mohen Jo Daro. He had analyzed that the grid emerged from the tradition of Indus Valley.
The paper was co-authored by Dr. Jae Seung Park, Professor at the School of Architecture, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea and Javeria Manzoor Shaikh, PhD candidate in Healthcare Architecture at same University.
Dr. Kaleemullah Lashari, co-director, Center for Archeological & Environmental Research, in his paper on Makli, which is dubbed as largest necropolis of Islamic world and world's epigraphic wonder, reproached that the site, protected a century ago under preservation laws and subsequently declared as the world heritage under UNESCO conventions, has unfortunately suffered a colossal neglect as it neither been studied nor maintained. He urged for full documentation and scientific conservation strategy for Makli.
According to his study, most of the inscribed graves are neither dated nor give information regarding the person buried at Makli. It has created the problem in understanding the spatial growth of the graveyard. It however is well compensated with structural classification of the Cenotaphs showing perceptible evolution in the design, he concluded.
Dr. Mastoor Fatima Bukhari, Director, Archeology & Anthropology, Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur presented her paper on early historic period pottery, its history, earliest evidences, typology, designs/decoration, colors and motifs. She said that pottery provides most important information about the technologies and stylistic development of the past. The pottery has played a vital role in archeology and served as a document of important themes in human life and also a source of inspiration in the history of arts and crafts. She spoke about stamped pottery with different patterns and directly stamped on clay.
Another important paper "Tale of dying craft and identity: the saga of the Silawat Community" presented by Varda Nisar, who studied Architecture at University of and currently is freelance editor of online magazine, highlighted the role of Silawat community in architecture of Karachi. "The Silawat, which means 'Stone Masons', had been the force behind buildings like KMC Building, Merewether Tower, Mohatta Palace etc, but the impact of modernization has been such that their craft, a major source of their identity, would soon diminish, remaining as only a footnote in our history," she said.
The former Project Architect and Researcher of Karachi Heritage Building Resurvey Project, NED University, Tania Ali Soomro readout paper on conservation practices used in Karachi for protection of architectural heritage.
Renowned urban planner Arif Hassan Khan presided over the session.
## Technical Session - III-B (Sindhi language)
The critics of Sindhi short stories believe that the first original Sindhi story was 'Hur Mukhi Ja' (Hurs of Mukhi Lake of Sanghar) written by Lal Chand Amardinomal Jaghtiani in 1914. Thus the first Sindhi short story has completed its century in 2014, renowned Sindhi short story writer and former director, Institute of Sindhology, Jamshoro, Shoukat Hussain Shoro stated.
Presenting his paper 'One hundred years of Sindhi Short Story' at technical session on 'Sindhi Language' at second day of international seminar 'Sindh through the Centuries,' he discussed different periods, movements and trends of Sindhi short story during last one hundred years.
Referring to British efforts for standardization of Sindhi language, he said it was beginning of golden era in Sindhi literature, which provided impetus to Sindhi writers for writing and publishing Sindhi books related to various streams of literature. "Initially, short stories were translated into Sindhi from English and other languages. Afterwards, the Sindhi writers started writing original short stories depicting Sindhi society," he added.
Eminent poet Mr. Ayaz Gul, who is head, Department of Sindhi language, Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur, presented paper with overview of Sindhi Ghazal after the partition. According to him, Sindhi Ghazal writing started during Kalhora rule in Sindh and developed to present form passing through the centuries. He highlighted the role of Sindhi poetry in raising the social issues of society including the human rights. The paper covered evolution of Sindhi Ghazal in Sindh and India in pre-and post-partition era.
Mr. Tufail Chandio, Lecturer in English, University of Sindh, Laar Campus, Badin, in his paper 'Social dynamics of Sindh and the poignant impact of Sindhi proverbs developing massive mindset among natives', analyzed the social fabrics of Sindhi society and impact of Sindhi proverbs or sayings, which inculcate a negative mindset leading to passivism and inaction, hence all the doors to activism, progress and development stay shut upon the natives.
Mr. Chandio referred several studies conducted on why eastern societies are less inclined to progress, social change and development as compared to the western ones.
Mr. Taj Joyo, a renowned poet and secretary, Sindhi Language Authority, presented paper on academic and literary services of Mr. G. M. Syed. He said, Saeen G. M. Syed, who is author of several books, was the person behind establishment of Sindhi Adabi Board.
Dr. Rafique Ahmed Mangrio, professor at Government Muslim College, Hyderabad and author of 25 research papers, spoke on advent of Islam in Sindh, history and geographical boundaries of Sindh before Islam etc.
Intellectual, writer, former government officer MPA Madam Mahtab Akber Rashdi in her presidential remarks said papers presented by Dr. Rafique Mangrio and Mr. Mohammad Tufail Chandio raised several questions that need to be discussed thoroughly.
Noted poet Mr. Imdad Hussaini speaking as the chief guest traced the history of verbal and written poetry. According to him the common man used to speak correct words but unfortunately the poets were making mistakes in usage of words. 
Mr. Imdad Hussaini also recited his latest poem and received applause by the audience.
Later, Madam Mahtab Akber Rashdi and Vice Chancellor of SMI University Dr. Mohammad Ali Shaikh gave away shields to the scholars.
## Technical Session- IV- A (History of Sindh-1)
The Mongol conquests and migrations in Sindh and other Indus borderlands in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were not only responsible for the destruction of sedentary agriculture and village life in many areas but equally led to demise or weakening of existing patterns of culture and religion.
"The destruction of culture, religion and social cohesion over two centuries of Mongol conquests and tribal migrations, in combination with pervasive nomad-ization and raiding paved the way for subsequent conversion to Islam and formation of new pir-and-shrine-centered forms of religious organization. The latter were instrumental in religious conversion as much as the restoration of a war-damaged society, the arbitration of land rights among settled and nomadic populations and community building," said Dr. Andre Wink, Professor of History, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA, in his paper presented at technical session on 'History of Sindh-I.'
Dr. Mathew A. Cook, another American scholar, who is Assistant Professor of Post-Colonial & South Asian Studies at North Carolina Central University, in his paper titled 'The annexation of Sindh and socio-cultural distinctions' said local support for the British in 1843 hinged on internal social relations among Sindh's Hindus and attempts to challenge distinctions of status within this community. "I argue that such local distinctions give important insights into larger processes (for example the establishment of global empires).
His paper looked beyond the imperial great game and economic rationalism in the global expansion of British Empire. He focused on how Hindu merchants supported the British Empire. According to the US scholar, the British Empire provided property security and types of institutional stability that indigenous states were incapable of guaranteeing. As a result, the merchants abandoned indigenous states and shifted their support in favor of British sovereignty.
Saaz Aggarwal, an Indian writer, painter and literary critic, who had been continuously documenting aspects of Sindhi Diaspora, presented her paper titled 'Wherever' that focused on mass migration of Sindhi Hindus from Sindh and who settled in different parts of world.' According to her, they migrated to such regions, which were isolated and had a unique culture; therefore they had to learn new languages, and adapted new lifestyles. The paper presented 66-year seamless efforts of Hindus of Sindh and explored possible reasons for their material success, their abandonment of culture and the reasons for which they have remained silent about their loss and trauma.
US scholar Dr. Rita P. Wright's paper on 'Mohen Jo Daro and Harapa: The Indus, its rivers and responses to environment chage' was read by Ms. Nilofar Shaikh.
Humera Naz, lecturer in Department of General History, University of readout her paper titled 'Fateh Namah-i-Sindh alias Chach Namah: The first magnum opus of the history of Sindh' while Dr. Abdullah Aftab Abro presented paper on 'Historical perspective of research on Indus Script'.
Scholar and historian Dr. Hamida Khuhro presided over the session.
## Technical Session IV-B (Cultural Heritage of Sindh)
Dr. Thomas Darnhardt from Ca' Foscari University of Venice in his paper 'Multi-Cultural Perspective' pointed out the presence of a cross-cultural devotional cult, deeply rooted in the imagination of popular Sindhi culture in which both Hindu and Muslim devotees join in some places in Hyderabad, Thatta and Sukkur provinces of the Sindh.
He analyzed figure and cult of Amarlāl, the 'immortal' saint, also known as Jhulelāl, the 'swinging child', as it is known among Hindus and the parallel cult of Khwāja Khiḍr, the mysterious guide of those endowed with spiritual insight dear to both trans-regional Sufis and local communities.
Mukhtar Ali Durrani, an Associate Professor at the Institute of Chemical Sciences, University of Peshawar presented his paper on 'Tomb of Hamshera (sister) of Jam Fateh Khan at Makli Hill, Thatta, Sindh: History and Architecture'.
He said that the tomb of Hamsheera (sister) of Jam Fateh Khan was constructed in AD 1465. Her name is shrouded in mystery however the only one recognition as an important personality to be known in the historical and epigraphic sources is mentioned as Hamsheera Jam Fateh Khan, who remained the ruler of Sindh from AD 1413 to 1428.
Durrani stated that the tomb under study was constructed during the second half of the 15th century AD. This tomb as a whole reflects the beginning of a new style at Makli Hill necropolis that is the initiation of a perfect three-tier building architecture. In the present work, besides the historical significance and the architectural glory, the epigraphic evidences shall also be discussed at length in order to reach the conclusion.
Dr. Kamal Jamro, Chairman of the Department of Sindhi, Federal Urdu University, Karachi in his paper 'An analysis of research on Sindhi folklore (1970-2013)' said that folk literature is a real picture of the society. "It presents the portrait of any nation's culture, traditions, rituals and rhythms of life. Folk poetry in particular can be thought of as a beautiful flower in a desert, which not only has an aesthetic charm but also an inimitable fragrance", he said. According to him like other enlightened nations, Sindhi folk poetry is also very rich in thought and tune. Sindhi folk poetry has a huge impact on Sindhi society.
Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Qureshi, Assistant Professor, Department of Communication and Media Studies, University of Jamshoro presented his paper on 'Peculiarity of vowels in Sindhi music communication'. According to him Sindhi music, basically, in its very nature is folk-oriented culture, therefore it has the distinct quality of having a huge number of vowels.
Dr Ahmad Hussain from University Of Haripur presented his paper on 'Unfolding Nature, Vivacity and Life in Sindh Culture through the accounted Behavior among the Elites'. He said that the recognition of fundamental importance of greenery suggested a probe to be served in Sindh culture to know the deep roots it carried not only on common masses but also on privileged groups. He stated that the human society and civilization in Sindh was greatly inspired and influenced by nature including rivers, plants and animal life. This was depicted by the agricultural practices along the Indus and forests of Indus, shrines of priests on scenic sites and the historical, fossil and archeological record of civilizations and animal species.
Former Secretary Culture, Sindh Mr. Abdul Hamid Akhund in his presidential remarks said that culture of Sindh was not stagnant and resembled it with flowing water of Indus River. According to him archeological sites of Gandhara and Mehr garh were also part of Indus civilization.
## TTechnical Session V-A (Belief Systems & Mythology)
The earliest archeological evidence of Swastika-shaped ornaments, a symbol of auspiciousness in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, dates back to Indus Valley Civilization as well as the Mediterranean Classical Antiquity and Paleolithic Europe, says Esther Park, a South Korean research scholar and Secretary General, Gandhara Art & Cultural Association, also working as visiting professor at Fatima Jinnah University.
In her paper presented at technical session on 'Belief Systems & Mythology' she focused on Swastika-shaped ornaments found in Mohen Jo Daro and other parts of Sindh and its significance through centuries.
Esther Park said Swastika word comes from Sanskrit Svastika - 'su' (meaning good or auspicious) combined with 'asti' (meaning it is) along with diminutive suffix 'ka'. The Swastika literally means 'it is good'. "It is a common practice for Hindus to draw Swastika symbol on the doors and entrances to their houses during festivals, which is believed to symbolize an invitation to goddess Lakshmi."
Michel Boivin, director of research at CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research), who specializes in anthropological history of Muslim countries in South Asia, and is author of book 'Artifacts of Devotion: A Sufi Repertoire of the Qalandaryya in Sehwah Sharif, Sindh', presenting his paper titled 'Somewhat of the charm of the wild flowers: Language, Literature and building of Sufi culture in colonial Sindh' quoted John Beams, a civil servant in British India, as saying that 'Sindhi language had got somewhat charm of the wild flowers'.
The scholar, who sought to understand the process through which a new culture was produced in colonial Sindh, said British started to standardize both the script and language. The grammars were published soon and later after the learning of Sindhi was compulsory for British officers, they were interested by the structure of the language and above all with its connections with other North Indian languages. They depicted Sindhi as rude language expressed by a rude population; he said and added that nevertheless others simultaneously tagged the Sufi poetry as 'beautiful'.
Dr. Jurgen Schaflechner, Phd degree-holder of Heidelberg University, and Masters degree in Modern South Asian Languages & Literature, Comparative Religion & Classical Ideology with thesis 'The Godess Hinglaj', presented paper on 'The Shrine of Hinglaj Devi or Bibi Nana', and focused on how the shrine in Balochistan had been rearticulated in different time-periods to appropriate political claims. He spoke on Hinglaj's role in the political upward mobility of certain castes and communities, foremost the Khatris; and the modern day approach in Sindhi scholarly writing.
Dr. Supriya Banik Pal, a former Associate Professor in the Department of Sanskrit at Sarat Centenary College, India, presented paper on 'Sindhu or Sindh: A study through the Mahabharata' exploring the rich heritage and culture of Sindh or Sindhu in the light of epic Mahabharata.
Ms Fouzia Naz, M Phil scholar at Taxila Institute of Asian Civilization, Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad readout her paper on 'Belief System of Indus Valley people based on seals'. Her paper focused on seal, sealing, tablets, figurines and plaques to find out religious traditions that kept them alive to this date.
Dr. Mohan Dev Raj, research scholar from India who is author of book 'Shrines of Maheshvari Meghwar Saints in Sindh', presented a paper 'Facts about seven Mamoi Fakeers and the Shri Mamoi Dev, the great historic and spiritual personality of Sindh and Kachh'.
MNA Syeda Nafeesa Shah in her presidential address said Sindh is known for land that respects all the beliefs. "Unfortunately some of the chapters of history have been excluded from the textbooks in Pakistan and a different definition of Islam is being taught here that has promoted extremism," she said. "Every Pakistani is targeted by the terrorists. We are fighting the war of ideology and beliefs. He described historians, writers and researchers as the warriors of history who can save Sindh and the country from terrorism.
## Technical Session V-B (History of Sindh- II)
Scholars belonging to USA and Pakistan highlighted different aspects of history of Sindh on Tuesday, second day of the three-day international seminar 'Sindh through the Centuries.' Dr. Amir Ali Chandio, Professor, Department of Political Science, Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur in his paper 'Role of Sindh in Freedom Movement: An Analysis of Hur Tahreek' said history of Sindh province is mentioned in the textbooks, and the books of the history of independence but the role of Hur Tahreek has been ignored and forgotten despite of the fact that Hur Tahreek played vital role in the freedom movement of Sub-continent.
Parveen Talpur, writer and historian from USA, whose paper on 'Indus Seals (2600-1900 BCE) Beyond Geometry to their Socio-cultural Context', was presented on her behalf by Javeria Shaikh, said that the first case examines the main sign which appears on a large number of seals. Possibly this sign was used for calculating angles and has given birth to a word that is widely spread in a number of languages. According to her the second case examines the object that mostly appears with the animal images. It has been interpreted in various ways, perhaps it has an astral significance as it is also substituted with the stars. Parveen was of the view that third sample examines a narrative seal that sheds some light on the ancient Indus ideology and carries hints that can be related to a few legends of Sindh. She explained that the scope of interdisciplinary approach to crack the code of Indus seals needs to be widened to accommodate bits and pieces of information from a wide variety of sources along with the conventional sources, for these will eventually help in the reconstruction of the greater story of Indus Civilization.
Ms Zahida Rehman Jatt, Monitoring Officer, Rural Support Program Networks, Islamabad, presented her paper on 'Role of contributions of Sindhi Hindus in socio-economic and cultural life of Hyderabad, Sindh: 1800-1947. Sindhi Hindus worked in every sphere of life in pre-partitioned Hyderabad ranging from art and architecture, philanthropy, education, and politics. She said that some of the landmarks of that time like schools, teachers training institutes and public buildings are still standing today as testimony to the dexterity and passion of their builders.
Dr Shuja Ahmad, faculty member of Pakistan study Centre, University of Sindh, Jamshooro in his paper 'Struggle for separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency (1847-1936)' said that the struggle for separation of Sindh from the Bombay played a significant role in creating political awareness in Sindh.
He said that the positive impact of this movement was an active participation of Sindhis which enabled them to train themselves in politics and it proved to be the primary institution of political leadership. He said that the opportunities for progress were even greater in Sindh than in other parts of India but the exploitation of resources was hampered by lack of funds because of the negligence by the Bombay Presidency.
Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Shah, Assistant Professor at Department of English, Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur presented his research paper on 'Bilingual English Sindhi Dictionary'. He stated that the dictionaries are essentially good and carry many merits but in one aspect or in another. According to him not a single dictionary can be categorized and found on the sound principles of modern Lexicography. "A user-friendly dictionary based on the needs and requirements of learners and perfect in all aspects is still to come," he opined. Mr. Noor Ahmed Janjhi, Assistant Professor, Government Boys Degree College Mithi, Tharpakar in his paper "War of Independence in Parkar" revealed many aspects of patriotism, war strategy and human behavior.
Mr. Mohammad Moazzam Khan from WWF presented his paper on 'Fishery Industry of Sindh through Ages'. He said that Fisheries industry possibly developed into an organized industry during Harappa Civilization, while an organized pearl extraction industry based on window-pane oyster existed during the Talpur dynasty.
Renowned historian Dr. Mubarak Ali in his presidential remarks said that the real history of world is that of common man and masses while the history of Elites is written by force and cannot be described as peoples' history.

He viewed that more and more in-depth research is required on Sindh using modern technology.
## Report of 3 Day 2nd International Seminar on "Sindh Through the Centuries" (Day Three: Last Day)
## Technical Session –VI(Sindhi Language and Literature )
March 26, 2014
Sindhi language has got some peculiar linguistic features, which are not available in other modern languages of Indo-Pak subcontinent. Noticing this, European scholars and linguists have highly praised linguistic structure of Sindhi language, said Dr. Murlidhar Kisshinchand Jetley, a linguistic scholar from India.
Speaking as chief guest at technical session VI held on 'Sindhi language and Literature' on last day of International Seminar 'Sindh through the Centuries,' he quoted Captain George Stack who wrote in the introduction of his book 'Grammar of Sindhi Language' published in 1849 that Sindhi has more interesting dialects than many of other Indian languages' dialects. He also quoted Ernest Trumpp who also had expressed almost same opinion on linguistic peculiarities of Sindhi language in the introduction of his 'Grammar of Sindhi language' in 1872.
Dr. Jetley, vice chairman of Sindhi Academy of Dehli and former professor of Dehli University, said they were striving hard to keep alive Sindhi language in India. "Young generation of Sindhis in India takes interest only in English medium, as their parents wanted them to be officers. The result is that the number of Sindhi speaking youths is on decline. In view of such a situation we have started summer workshops to teach the youth Sindhi language," he told adding that results are encouraging as the kids now urge parents for speaking in Sindhi.
Another writer from India, Kailash Shaadaab in his paper on 'Humanism in classical Sindhi poetry' said much before Europeans learned the lesson of humanism, it was the of Eastern culture. "All the classical poetry of Indian subcontinent in general and that of Sindh in particular are replete with spirit of Humanism." He said classical poets of Sindh such as Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Sachal Sarmast and others had devoted them to the spread of humanism. "In modern globalised and democratic world, the humanism has come to be recognized as one of the most respected values. The classical poets of Sindh had realized the importance of humanism many centuries ago. They considered yeoman service as the greatest duty towards divine."
Dr. Vinod H. Asudani, a researcher, poet, psychologist and scholar from India, in his paper titled 'Expression of Image of Sindh' spoke on how the Sindhi writers and poets artistically and aesthetically depicted image of motherland. He especially mentioned the works of Sindhi writers and poets who had to migrate from Sindh as a result of partition in 1947.
Dr Vinod said the artistic expression is not only confined to the notion of nostalgia but it takes into its fold the history, geography, mythology, culture and many other dimensions of Sindh as well. "In fact, Sindh is reflected as dynamic and fascinating organism in literature," he added.
Dr. Fahmida Hussain, renowned scholar and chairperson, Sindhi Language Authority, in her paper titled 'Socio-linguistic analysis of Sindhi society', shed light on gender-based discrimination in our society and contended that from a socio-linguistic perspective, inequality and injustice in the society is also manifested as linguistic discrimination in the use of language. "From the perspective of feminism, there are two aspects worth considering. Firstly, to identify difference in language between men and women on the basis of social status and as such differences that exist in the language used by men and women to assert themselves," Dr. Fahmida said. According to her, in some cultures women are prohibited to express themselves in public with self-confidence and are even forbidden to raise voice.
Dr. Kamla Goklani, another scholar from India holding degree of doctorate in Sindhi, presented paper titled 'Comparative study of West Rajasthani and Sindhi Language' and highlighted similarity in Sindhi and Rajasthani language. According to her there are several words, phrases, verbs, proverbs and names of body parts that are similar in both languages. Dr. Kamla said she found 70 Marwari words, verbs, proverbs, phrases and names of body parts similar to Sindhi. She told that facility for PhD degree in Sindhi language is available in Delhi and Pune however they are striving to get such facility in Rajasthan too, where jobs are preferably offered to those who know the local languages.
Mr. Gul Mohammad Umrani of Dr. N. A. Baloch Foundation, spoke on 'Mirza Kalich Beg's World of Art & Literature' while Prof. Qalandar Shah Lakiari presented paper on 'Letters, Phonemes and Pronunciation'. Prof. Salim Memon read out his paper based on book review of Pir Ali Mohammad Rashdi.
## Technical Session - VII (Economy of Sindh)
An Indian economist Ms. Suman Sonkar said on Wednesday that Sindh has potential to become an important trade route between South Asia and Central Asia, while provincial advisor for finance Syed Murad Ali Shah also suggested improving Khokhrapar route between India and Pakistan that ultimately would benefit the economy of Sindh.
"What we need is to promote trade activities with India through Khokhrapar route. For this we should improve facilities at Khokhrapar on Pakistan side where presently we do not have even shelter from sunlight at immigration counters," he said comparing the best available facilities on Indian side.
Addressing the technical session VII on 'Economy of Sindh' at the International Seminar 'Sindh through Centuries' on last day of the event, Syed Murad Ali Shah said, "This route suits more for promotion of trade between two countries because Pakistan has large border with India and Karachi port is much closer to it than other ports of Pakistan."
Murad Ali Shah apprised audience about government efforts aimed at alleviating the poverty in Sindh however added that despite all the efforts no remarkable results could be achieved in this regard. About the Benazir Bhutto Income Support Program, he told that no disbursement could be done since last year and hardly fifty percent of allocated amount of Rs.12 billion have been disbursed so far. Talking about agriculture economy of the province, he expressed apprehension about water shortage in future in Sindh. Earlier, presenting her paper, Indian scholar Ms. Suman Sonkar said, "Pakistan provides an opportunity for Central Asian countries to diversify their international connections and to reduce the distance and the number of borders to be crossed to reach international maritime transportation hubs. For instance, the Central Asia-Afghanistan-Pakistan (Karachi Port) road corridor would provide potentially one of the cheapest and probably the quickest routes to Central Asia."
In her paper titled 'Revival of new Silk Route through Sindh' Ms. Suman, the professor of economics at Lakshmibai College, University of Delhi, said, "Pakistan refers Sindh province as the gateway to Central Asia and strongly believes that the good relations with region would not only enhance its security but also provide enormous economic opportunities." Highlighting the existing overland silk transport corridor between Pakistan and China, she explored the possible options to enhance the transport linkages from port of Karachi through Karakoram Highway and further to Central Asian region and even to Khartoum. "The study of the trade route will help in the development of the entire region," she added.
Indian scholar said it is the ancient passage that has connected the civilizations and thus promoted the multi-interchange between East and West. "This ancient route not only circulated goods but also exchanged the splendid cultures of China, India, Pakistan, Persia, Greek and Rome."
According to her Sindh has the potential to become an important transit route between South Asia and Central Asia. Hiro Thakur, another eminent scholar from India, speaking about courageous cattle traders and seafarers of ancient Sindh, said Rig Veda, the oldest composition which came into being in the first half of first Millennium BC, was composed on the banks of River Indus. He said Rig Veda suggests that the Punis were inhabitants of ancient Sindh and known as valiant, wealthy people who used to process enormous wealth of cows and horses. They were traders and eminent seafarers, he added.
Dr. Hari Lohano, University of West of England, speaking on Poverty Dynamics in Rural Sindh, suggested that policies to mitigate shocks in farming, enhancing sustainable growth in the agriculture sector, and improving non-farm employment opportunities in rural Sindh would reduce chronic poverty, prevent descent into poverty and allow escape from poverty in Sindh.
Mr. Ishtiaq Ansari of Sindh Heritage Cell, Hyderabad spoke on ecotourism in Sindh with special reference to Gorakh Hill Station and other resorts of the province, while Dr. Iqbal Panwar's paper shed light on agro-economic response to climate change in Sindh and Dr. Faisal Hussain presented analytical study on vegetation in Sindh.
## Concluding Session
Dr. Ishrat Hussain, head, Institute of Business Administration, and former Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, in his concluding keynote address said on Wednesday, March 26, 2014 (the last day of the International Seminar) said that economic development in Sindh is not possible without improving law and order situation and bridging the gap between rural and urban areas. "The development efforts should be focused more on rural areas so that they could be brought at par to urban areas." "Sindh possesses abundant economic resources but what we need is to utilize them properly," he viewed.
He said the 54 percent of country's economy depends on Karachi port while the agriculture had 23 to 24 percent share in economy but it declined to 17 percent due to neglect. He further stated that country's youth is in dire need of employment but unfortunately manufacturing sector has failed to create jobs and it is only the services sector that offers jobs.
Dr. Ishrat Hussain while describing Thar Coal Field as largest source of energy having vast potential, said, "We had been listening about Thar Coal since last 15 years but such a big source of energy has not yet been developed." "The indigenous resources are always utilized by the nations in case of crisis but the case here is contrary to it." Elaborating the urban and rural divide, Dr. Ishrat Hussain cited example of difference in literacy rate. "The literacy rate in Pakistan is said to be 59 percent while it is 75 percent in urban and only 42 percent in rural areas. The gender-wise literacy figures show further difference as female literacy rate in rural areas is only 22 percent while it is 68 percent in urban areas."
Dr. Ishrat Hussain said the rural areas have big role in economy but unfortunately they have very less purchasing power. He also spoke of dearth of healthcare facilities in rural areas.
Dr. Hamida Khuhro, Convenor, Organizing Committee of the International Seminar, offered thanks to the foreign delegates and participants and gave overview of the three day proceedings of event. She praised the efforts of scholars and hoped their papers would help planners and future researchers. She also praised the efforts of Vice Chancellor of SMI University Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh for organized such mega event. Vice Chancellor, Sindh Madressatul Islam University, Dr. Mohammad Ali Shaikh in his concluding remarks supported the point of view expressed by Syed Murad Ali Shah, Advisor to the Sindh Chief Minister for Finance that trade through the Khokhrapar route should be restored at the earliest. "What is harm in it", he said adding that restoration of the Khokhrapar trade will not only boost trade in Sindh but also improve economy of the country.
On the occasion he announced establishing an institute on Sindh studies at the SMI university. The institute will award doctorate degrees in arts, culture, history, language, economy and other aspects of Sindh. At the same time he assured to organize another seminar on Sindh saying that this time we will not wait for another 39 years.
Earlier the standing ovation was given to Dr Murlidhar Jetley, a noted scholar, on his remarkable work on Sindhi language and Dr Mohammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of SMI University on his marvelous efforts to organize a memorable International Seminar on Sindh Through the Centuries.

###### Department of English 
Department of English has been established to provide a comprehensive blend of linguistic-cum-literary education system to BS English undergraduates. The department has been initiated in order to equip our students with the knowledge of English linguistic and literary trends to make them communicatively competent in diversified academic and professional fields. The purpose of establishing Sindh Madressatul Islam School was to provide modern education to the Muslims of Sindh (sub-continent) in 1885. Subsequently, SMI College was upgraded to the status of University in 2012; where five departments were initially established and presently five more departments have been inducted. Department of English is one of them offering BS English (Four year) degree program. Currently, English teaching faculty consists of seven members headed by PhD faculty member.

#### [SMIU organises panel discussion on “Role of Industries in Academic Sector, Conference for Youth 7.0” ](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/<#>)
The academicians and industrialists have stressed upon the need to work together for strengthening cooperation in private and public sector of the county that is needed for development of Pakistan. They suggested that the academia must share their research work with industries and also include Industry Semester to their syllabus of final year, that is why students could get six-month internship from industries. This was stated at a panel discussion organised by the ORIC and Business Incubation Center of SMIU with collaboration of the Entrepreneurs Den on the subject of “Role of Industries in Academic Sector, Conference for Youth 7.0” at Sindh Madressatul Islam University on Thursday, September 26, 2024. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, Vice Chancellor of SMIU said the public sector universities of the country are doing very well. Research scholars of the universities are also contributing greatly towards the development of the country; hence the industrial sector should get benefit from these researches. The vice chancellor said we are producing not only good graduates but responsible youth, therefore their participation in the industries would be valuable for industries as well as for the country. Dr. Sahrai further said universities are receiving about 80 percent students from public sector schools and colleges. In addition to it, he said despite limited resources the universities are producing good results. “SMIU will prefer to establish collaboration with the industries of the country,” the vice chancellor said and added that along with Karachi the industrialists must extend their cooperation to the universities working in Karachi, Dadu, Sukkur, Khairpur, Hyderabad, Larkana, Mianwali, Khuzdar and other cities of all provinces of the country. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai thanked the guests who participated in the discussion. He also praised the efforts of SMIU’s Director ORIC Dr. Mansoor Ahmed Khuhro, Assistant Professors Ms. Quratulain Nazir, Mr. Shahid Obaid and others for organising the successful event. 
Mr. Hamza Y. Tabbani, Chairman Tabbani Group of Industries said we are 50 years behind the developed world and Artificial Intelligence is dominating on all fields of life, hence we all have to play our due role in the country. 
He further said today’s students are enjoying latest facilities to enhance their knowledge and experience, but they should not waste their time on social media and other such activities. He was of the view that we are facing price hike at large, therefor in such conditions single bread earner could not bear all expenses of a family, hence each and every person has to contribute to the family and to the country as well. 
Mr. Bilal Talib, CEO California Real Estate and Builder said we have to move ahead by accepting challenges. He said the success through any lottery is not sustainable, experiences of life and training play a key role in individual’s success. Therefore, the young generation must believe in continuous struggle and consistency in their efforts. He suggested that the young generation must set their goals and targets of life. 
Senator Abdul Haseeb Khan, Chairman Brooks Pharmaceutical said in today’s world the young people should not look towards public sector jobs, but they should move towards the entrepreneurship. Sharing his experiences in the field business the 85 years old Senator Haseeb Khan said that he had started a small business in the age of 12 years, now about 2000 workers are related with his business. He advised the students to take initiative in their young age and will succeed with the passage of time. 
Mr. M Aman Pir, member of Advisory Board of America Pakistan Business Development Forum said in the present day challenging world education has an important relationship with the industry, therefore they must collaborate with each other. 
Dr. Jamshed Adil Halepoto, Dean Faculty of Management, Business Administration and Commerce at SMIU said that we have not created business culture in the country yet, that is why majority of youth is preferring to the public sector jobs, but youth must understand the reality that they may earn more through business rather than any job and that act will also bring a qualitative change in the society. 
Earlier, Director ORIC Dr. Mansoor Ahmed Khuhro in his welcome address thanked the guests and said that the collaboration between universities and industries is key to innovation, entrepreneurship, and preparing students for the real world. At ORIC, we are committed to building strong connections between academia and industry, ensuring that our research and learning directly benefit society. Mr. Babar Saleem, Mr. Rehan and Ms. Saima Siddique also shared their views. 
On this occasion Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai gave away souvenirs to the guests, while Mr. Bilal Talib presented shields to SMIU’s Dean Dr. Zahid Ali Channar, Dr. Jamshed Adil Halepoto, Mr. Shahid Obaid, Assistant Professor, Mr. Muhammad Naeem Ahmed, Assistant Professor, Mr. Poorab Sarhan, Lecturer, Mr. Muhammad Danish Mujtaba, Lecture, Muzafar Ali Shah, Lecture, Mr. Shafiq Ahmed, Lecturer, Syed Bilal Ahmed and Anwar Ali Abro.

#### [Sindh Madressatul Islam University and WWF Launch Plastic Recovery Bank ](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/<#>)
Sindh Madressatul Islam University, in collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Pakistan Beverages Limited launched the Plastic Recovery Bank (PRB), an innovative initiative designed to encourage active participation in plastic collection and recycling on September 24, 2024. This project targets individuals, communities, and organizations, offering them financial incentives to engage in environmentally responsible behaviors. The Vice Chancellor of SMIU Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai inaugurated the Plastic Recovery Bank at the campus.
Addressing the launching ceremony held at Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium of the university the Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai highlighted urgency of addressing environmental issues like plastic waste and emphasized the importance of recycling in reducing the production of new plastic. 
His remarks focused on how initiatives like the PRB are essential in confronting global environmental challenges. He said that the PRB marks a crucial step forward in the collective fight against plastic waste and setting a precedent for future sustainability projects. Dr. Sahrai said today the entire world is facing a great threat of environmental degradation, therefore we all have collectively work to make the world environmentally sustainable and free from any threat.
Dr. Hina Shehnaz, Chairperson of the Department of Environmental Sciences at SMIU said that the PRB not only provides monetary rewards but also fosters a strong culture of environmental stewardship. She said that by aligning with WWF, a global leader in conservation, this initiative is expected to make a significant impact, both locally and internationally. 
Ms. Nazifa Butt, Director of Climate Action and Sustainability at WWF, along with Usama Hussain, Regional Senior Sustainability and Circularity Officer, and Sahib Alam Khan, Senior Officer for Circularity and Sustainability, provided valuable insights on how the PRB aligns with WWF’s broader climate action strategies and sustainability goals. They emphasized that the PRB has the potential to revolutionize Pakistan’s waste management practices and accelerate the transition to a circular economy.
They said that the core objective of this initiative is to promote the circular economy, with a particular focus on plastic circularity. It will target the collection and recycling of PET plastics, multi-layer plastics, and used beverage cartons by fostering collaboration between key stakeholders in these sectors. The speakers were of the view that through this kind of efforts, WWF aims to align with its global mission of addressing the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, creating a positive and far-reaching impact on both the environment and the economy.
Representatives from Pakistan Beverages Limited (PBL), including Co-CEO Nusair Siraj Teli and General Manager Agha Muhammad Khan, also shared their insights. 
The event was organized by the Directorate of Students’ Affairs & Counselling (DSA) of SMIU in collaboration with the Department of Environmental Science of the Sindh Madressatul Islam University. Muhammad Naeem Ahmed, Director of DSA concluded the seminar by delivering a heartfelt vote of thanks, expressing gratitude to all the participants, speakers, and partners for their contributions and support in making the event a success.

#### [SMIU organises panel discussion on “Role of Industries in Academic Sector, Conference for Youth 7.0” ](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/viewnews/smiu-organises-panel-discussion-on-role-of-industries-in-academic-sector-conference-for-youth-7.0>)
The academicians and industrialists have stressed upon the need to work together for strengthening cooperation in private and public sector of the county that is needed for development of Pakistan. They suggested that the academia must share their research work with industries and also include Industry Semester to their syllabus of final year, that is why students could get six-month internship from industries. This was stated at a panel discussion organised by the ORIC and Business Incubation Center of SMIU with collaboration of the Entrepreneurs Den on the subject of “Role of Industries in Academic Sector, Conference for Youth 7.0” at Sindh Madressatul Islam University on Thursday, September 26, 2024. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, Vice Chancellor of SMIU said the public sector universities of the country are doing very well. Research scholars of the universities are also contributing greatly towards the development of the country; hence the industrial sector should get benefit from these researches. The vice chancellor said we are producing not only good graduates but responsible youth, therefore their participation in the industries would be valuable for industries as well as for the country. Dr. Sahrai further said universities are receiving about 80 percent students from public sector schools and colleges. In addition to it, he said despite limited resources the universities are producing good results. “SMIU will prefer to establish collaboration with the industries of the country,” the vice chancellor said and added that along with Karachi the industrialists must extend their cooperation to the universities working in Karachi, Dadu, Sukkur, Khairpur, Hyderabad, Larkana, Mianwali, Khuzdar and other cities of all provinces of the country. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai thanked the guests who participated in the discussion. He also praised the efforts of SMIU’s Director ORIC Dr. Mansoor Ahmed Khuhro, Assistant Professors Ms. Quratulain Nazir, Mr. Shahid Obaid and others for organising the successful event. 
Mr. Hamza Y. Tabbani, Chairman Tabbani Group of Industries said we are 50 years behind the developed world and Artificial Intelligence is dominating on all fields of life, hence we all have to play our due role in the country. 
He further said today’s students are enjoying latest facilities to enhance their knowledge and experience, but they should not waste their time on social media and other such activities. He was of the view that we are facing price hike at large, therefor in such conditions single bread earner could not bear all expenses of a family, hence each and every person has to contribute to the family and to the country as well. 
Mr. Bilal Talib, CEO California Real Estate and Builder said we have to move ahead by accepting challenges. He said the success through any lottery is not sustainable, experiences of life and training play a key role in individual’s success.

Sindh Madressatul Islam University celebrated 140th Foundation Day of SMI with great enthusiasm and commitment. In this connection 3-Day Celebration activities were organised by the Directorate of Students’ Affairs and Counselling, from 1st September to 3rd September. 
A grand ceremony of SMI’s Foundation Day was held on Monday, September 2, 2024 at the Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium. Different groups of the students of SMIU Model School and SMI University performed on folk songs and delivered speeches on SMI’s historic role in modern education which it played during pre and post-independence period of Pakistan. A group of students led by a teacher Dr. Akbar Ali Chandio presented a poem on SMI. Messages of SMIU alumni who are studying abroad as well as those who are serving different organizations in the country were also played. A great tribute was paid to the founder of SMI Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi and distinguished alumnus of SMI and founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others. Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, Vice Chancellor of SMIU, students, deans and officers also participated in the cake cutting ceremony. Dr. Sahrai announced Rs.2000/- and Rs.3000/-for each student of SMIU Model School and SMI University, who performed during the Foundation Day, from his own pocket, not from SMIU. 
In his address at the ceremony Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai talked on the social and educational conditions of this region in the colonial period of British rule and highlighted enlightened thoughts, modern approach and tireless struggle of Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi for establishment of a modern school- Sindh Madressatul Islam in Karachi for Muslim children. 
He said the period under British rule was most difficult for Muslims. They were deprived of their fundamental rights and were kept at a distance from official responsibilities, benefits and privileges. That social injustice compelled Hassanally Effendi and his friends to bring a change in the community and in the society through establishing a modern institution that could educate their kids according to the demand of the day. “Hassanally Effendi was not a wealthy person, but he was belonging to a lower middle class family and had started his career as a clerk. He realized that establishing a modern education institution is the only way to restore dignity of the community and attain progress. 
Dr. Sahrai said there are three stages of SMI. Firstly, it was founded as a school on 1st September 1885, then it was upgraded to a level of college on 21st June 1943 and was inaugurated by Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the third stage was getting university status on February 16, 2012. “During this whole journey of success SMI has never forgotten its prime responsibility of providing modern and quality education to its younger generations. 
He said Sindh Madressatul Islam school is an integral part and asset of Sindh Madressatul Islam University that will be made more developed in coming days. 
“When I had assumed charge of vice chancellorship of SMIU some four years ago in August 2020, I was shocked to see the affairs of the SMI Model School which was being run from the budget of SMI university. It was not good omen for the school, because how much long the university could have sustained its expenditures, then I took efforts and received a separated budge of Rs90 million for the school from Government of Sindh. “Before him the SMI University was also being run in more than 60 percent of deficit. There was only 1800 enrollment, but now after four years SMIU is being run in surplus and there are more than 5500 students at SMIU. “In the next four years SMI University and SMIU Model School will be more developed,” the vice chancellor pledged and added that now our focus will be on the internationalization and ranking of SMIU. 
He was of the view that we must make our institutions sustainable because, these are pillars of the development of the country also. The Vice Chancellor said we must come out from conventional approaches and be committed because in the 21st century every second is very much important in the life, that couldn’t be wasted. 
Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai further said at present although he is the senior most vice chancellor in Sindh province, but he considers himself a professor of the province, of the country and of the world as well. Likewise, all people must be loyal to their institutions, their province, their country and the world. He was of the opinion that we should not underestimate our younger people, they are tomorrows leaders, only our educational institutions should groom them in right direction. 
Earlier, Mr. Naeem Ahmed, Director of the Students Affairs and Counselling presented welcome address. Deans Dr. Jamshed Adil Halepoto and Dr. Zahid Ali Channar also spoke. The ceremony was attended by students, faculty, officers and other employees in a large number. 
To celebrate the foundation day of SMIU the Directorate of Students Affairs and Counselling (DSA) also organised a Table Tennis Tournament between male and female students of the university on Monday, September 2, 2024 at SMIU’s premises. Later on Dr. Abdul Hafeez Khan, Advisor on Academic Affairs and Mohammad Naeem Ahmed, Director DSA distributed certificate among the players.
On the third and last day of the celebrations- Tuesday, September 3, a newly established Coffee House was inaugurated by the Vice Chancellor of SMIU Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai.

Thereafter in his speech Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sarahi in congratulated the entire nation of the 78th Independence Day of Pakistan. He also paid great tribute to the founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who was an alumnus of SMI and other leaders of the Independence Movement for their successful peaceful struggle for Pakistan. 
He said young generation of Pakistan must be optimist and value the freedom they are enjoying today. Dr. Sahrai further said that we have to forget that what has happened in the past, now every individual of the country has to play his/her role to bring peace, harmony, prosperity and development in the country. He further said about 30 years before achieving independence on 14th August 1947, there were more critical and difficult conditions for Muslim leaders when they were struggling for Pakistan without arms under the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, but they ultimately achieved their independent Country-Pakistan.

The Department of Media and Communication Studies at SMIU organized an interactive session on “Children with Inclusive Needs” at the university’s auditorium on June 6, 2024. The session was presided over by Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, with noted philanthropist and Chairman of the Edhi Foundation, Mr. Faisal Edhi, serving as the chief guest. During the event, final-year students from the department presented video reports and short films on the daily lives, activities, and challenges faced by special persons as part of their final-year projects. 
In his address, Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai noted that special persons constitute about 16 percent (more than 1 billion) of the world’s population. He highlighted that there are 15 million special persons in Pakistan and stressed that society must treat them as valued individuals, ensuring that necessary facilities are provided in buildings and public transport. 
Dr. Sahrai emphasized that for the country’s development, all marginalized communities, including women and special persons, must be included in every field. He mentioned that Sindh Madressatul Islam University had incorporated facilities for special persons in its buildings being constructed on the Malir campus. 
Dr. Sahrai welcomed Mr. Faisal Edhi, the son of the distinguished philanthropist Mr. Abdul Sattar Edhi and chairman of the Edhi Foundation, to Sindh Madressatul Islam University. At the Vice Chancellor's suggestion, the audience gave a standing ovation to honor the great services of Abdul Sattar Edhi. Dr. Sahrai remarked, “There were few individuals in the world who had no controversy, and Mr. Abdul Sattar Edhi was one of them,” and he commended Mr. Faisal Edhi for continuing his father's noble mission. The Vice Chancellor offered his support for any future needs related to humanitarian service. 
Dr. Sahrai also praised the video reports prepared by the students of the Department of Media and Communication Studies, noting that they had fulfilled their social responsibility. 
In his address, Mr. Faisal Edhi stated that those special persons engaged in small businesses are the real heroes and deserve support. He emphasized that these individuals strive for a better life and wish to contribute to society, thus requiring our support. 
Mr. Edhi highlighted that Karachi had 2 million children enrolled in primary schools, while 2.6 million children were out of school. He called for efforts to provide education to all children in the country. 
He shared an anecdote about meeting a Palestinian diplomat in Islamabad a few years’ prior, requesting permission to start work for children in Gaza. The diplomat had responded that while Egypt could grant such permission, despite the war imposed by Israel at that time, Gaza had a literacy rate of over 98 percent and was operating three shifts of schools due to a shortage of buildings. Mr. Edhi argued that, given there is no war-like situation in Pakistan, efforts should be made to educate all children, and if necessary, schools should operate in multiple shifts like in Gaza. 
Mr. Edhi noted that there are currently no “nuns” in Karachi, who were mainly from Christian and Hindu communities. This lack of support affects many children’s homes in Karachi, such as Darulsukun. He also pointed out that decreased financial support from European countries due to their engagement in wars has created a crisis for welfare organizations. 
He stressed the need for a skilled Pakistan where both normal and special children receive vocational training. Mr. Edhi appreciated Vice Chancellor Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai and the students of the Department of Media and Communication Studies for organizing such an important session. 
Special persons including Saba Ghizali, Gold Medalist, PhD Scholar, and visiting faculty at SMIU; Syed Ali Hassan, Sub Editor of Monthly Qaumi Zaban, Anjuman-i-Taraqqi-i-Urdu; Preeti Varodra, receptionist at TDF Magnificence Centre; and Ali Khan Tareen, Co-CEO and Founder of Khas Foodz, shared their success stories. They suggested that the government should provide facilities in workplaces and public places for special persons. Savio M. Pereira, CEO of Darulsukun Welfare Society, also spoke about the needs and problems faced by special persons. At the end of the event, Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai presented shields to the guests.

Integrating this course into various disciplines ensures that students receive comprehensive support, by normalizing discussions around mental health, universities contribute to creating an inclusive and empathetic learning environment. 
The department of Media and Communication Studies in its recommendation suggested training for media personal to report ethically about human rights, justice, and social issues, working collectively with authorities to give out correct details, and using different media to teach communities how to stay safe and informed. 
It further said that the research centers should be established that should be dedicated to conducting studies, provide policy recommendations, and engage in advocacy to address pressing societal issues. 
The department of Business Administration recommended that that businesses have more responsibilities towards economic, social and environmental sustainability, therefore, entrepreneurship and social innovation culture should be promoted among higher education learners. It said that the practice of publishing sustainability reports has become widespread among companies globally, and it has become crucial for companies to take action to reduce the impact of their operations on the environment and society. There is a need to develop strategies to enhance capabilities of business students to understand various issues related to circular economy, waste management and business models.

Block chain technology can be implemented to the different industries to increase data security, decrease fraud and errors, and the improvement of records accuracy. Software industry is growing in Pakistan, therefore, students need to enhance their knowledge to others related filed like, Robotics, AI, and Big Data analytics. 
The Department of Language and Culture recommended that the culture and languages should be the part of curricula so that, learners can express and share their ideas with more confidence.

Going into depth of the then social fabric of subcontinent Dr. Syed Jaffar Ahmed said that there were two elite classes in the subcontinent at that time, among them one was of Nawabs, Nizams and feudal lords and other one was religious elite class, but Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was belonging to a middle class with enlightened thoughts. He further said there were only 24 percentage of Muslim population in the undivided India, but Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah tried to get provincial status for Muslim majority provinces like Sindh, NWFP (present KP) and Balochistan at aimed to bring the Muslim strength equal to the non-Muslim population. 
He said the Quaid was of the view that cultural minority becomes permanent political minority, and cultural majority becomes permanent political majority, hence these two never become one nation, that is why he struggled for separate country for Muslims.

The academicians and research scholars have said that new technologies have brought multiple challenges for teachers, students, policy makers and community as well. Thus, curriculum must be prepared according to the standards of the day and teachers should be updated about the changing occurring in science, education and social sectors. They said this during a panel discussion held on “Reimagining our Futures Together: A New Social Contract for Sustainable Education,” on the second and last day of the 1st SMIU Global Research Congress at SMIU. Dr Shahida Sajjad, Vice Chancellor Metropolitan University Karachi said our curriculum should address issues emerging from technological development, students should understand social responsibility and evaluation process and quality of education should be improved. She said students should not be competitors to each other, but they must be cooperative. Her was of the view that we must respect diversity and the social justice must prevail. Dr. Bushra Khurram, Assistant Professor of University of Karachi said vision, planning and care are necessary to face the challenges. She said students should be aware about things related to knowledge, attitude and conditions of the country. Dr. Najamunisa of SZABIST, Karachi said we are facing climate change and economic crisis, but the sustainable education is all about promoting global citizenship and there is a global economy. Now learner has become global learner. Hence keeping these things in mind we should improve teaching mythology. She said the basic challenge is curriculum reforms and teaching community must change their mindset, as they still believe in outdated and old thoughts and practices. Dr. Anjum Bano of Iqra University Karachi said teachers and students are not aware about sustainable goals of education, hence students, teachers and community must be introduced with them. Mr. Ajab Ali Lashari, lecturer of SMIU moderated the session, **Panel Discussion on Need of Policy Reforms to Promote Sustainable and Innovative Business Practices** Talking in a session of “Need of Policy Reforms to Promote Sustainable and Innovative Business Practices,” Mr. Ahmed Ali Siddiqui, Group Head of Compliance Meezan Bank said we must promote local industry and local manufacturing, without it, we couldn’t progress. He further said the business leaders are not adopting new technologies, hence most challenges are coming from them. He was of the view that whenever a ban or restrictions are imposed then our business community is changing their attitude and mode of working. Dr. Shujaat Mubarak, Dean CBM, IOBM said in our country manufacturing is not promoted. This is why, there is no sustainable manufacturing in Pakistan. He feared that in coming few years our textile industry will pass through more difficult days and its major parts have been shifted to Bangladesh. He said we are importing used electronic material including computers from other countries and when these are become out of order after a little bit usage, then they are burst, that is producing diseases including cancer specially in Karachi city. Mr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan, a country head of a private food company said in the pandemic era, some food companies that were relying on other countries for their material lost their business completely and other companies, that were relying on their indigenous sources, grown. He said food sector in our country is growing but there is an issue of quality food. Therefore, food companies must provide quality food to their customers. Dr. Jamshed Adil, Dean of SMIU said our businessmen are failed to adopt new technologies. Hence industry must accept challenges of the world. Mr. Naeem Ahmed Lecturer of SMIU was the moderator.

Mr. Cemal Sangu, Consul General of Türkiye has said that relations of Pakistan and Türkiye are very much friendly and Turkish government is trying to strengthen these brotherly relationships more strong. 
He expressed these views during a meeting, he held with Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, deans and other officials of the university on Thursday at the Conference Room of SMIU, during his visit to SMIU. 
Mr. Cemal Sangu said people of Pakistan especially of Sindh are of mystic thoughts. This land of Sindh has a number of prominent mystic poets like Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Similarly, people of Türkiye are believers of Sufism and we have also saint-poet Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi. Hence, we are working to bring people of Sindh and other provinces of Pakistan close to Turkish people for spreading love and harmony in the world. 
Tracing relationship of Sindh with Türkiye, he said founder of Sindh Madressatul Islam University Hassanally Effendi had strong relations with Türkiye’s Ottoman rulers. That is why he was given titles of “Bey” and “Effendi” by Sultan of Türkiye in the 19th century. “Government of Türkiye feels proud on the services of Khan Bahadur Hassanally Bye Effendi, rendered for promotion of modern education in Sindh by establishing the great institute of Sindh Madressatul Islam,” the Consul General said and added that the Turkish government with the collaboration of Department of Culture and antiquities of government of Sindh is working to restore the home place and tomb of Hassanally Effendi located in Hyderabad City. “There was no proper care and cleanness at the home and last resting place of Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi. Even there was a narrow street leading there, no vehicle could pass from it. This is why, our team members went there by foot,” he said and maintained that we have requested the commissioner of Hyderabad for clearing the street that leads to Effendi’s home. 
Mr. Cemal Sangu announced one PhD scholarship for a student of SMIU in Turkey’s University of Ankara or University of Istanbul. “This first scholarship will be given to a female student of SMIU on poverty cum merit bases. The SMIU shall nominate its deserving candidate for the scholarship. He said this scholarship will be given to SMIU student every year due to the association of its founder Hassanally Effendi’s relationship with Türkiye. 
He further said Turkish government had given 128 scholarships to Pakistan’s students for undergraduate, graduate and post graduate programs, last year. Therefore, students of Pakistan must be encouraged to avail these opportunities. 
Vice Chancellor of SMIU Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai lauded the offer of Turkish Consul General for giving a scholarship to SMIU’s student for PhD. He said SMIU will open a Rumi Chair in SMIU and Turkish Corner, where information about Türkiye’s history, literature, culture and education will be available for SMIU’s students.

Mr. Khalil Ibrahim Basaran, TIKA Karachi Program Coordinator talked on the projects of TIKA in Sindh and said we are working to support the people of Sindh as they are Sufi from their core of heart. In this respect we are arranging Turkish language classes here also. Documentaries on SMIU and TIKA were also screened on the occasion.

Mr. Nisar Ahmed Memon was of the view that Indus delta is enrich with mangrove forests and other hidden treasures, hence sweet water is needed for its ecosystem. Talking on the Pakistan Vision 2025 he suggested key goals for responding to climate change. In this respect he said design water, food and energy security policies and plans with specific reference to climate change challenges, recognition of relevant risks and implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies and promoting long term sustainability, conservation and protection of natural resources are needed.

The Sindh Madressatul Islam University celebrated its 138th on Thursday, 1st September 2022 foundation day at the Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Auditorium, with simplicity due to the present day sorrowful conditions of people of the country created by torrential rains and flood. It was the first time in the history of SMIU that no cake cutting ceremony was held and not a singing session by students and other such jubilations were held on the occasion. While addressing the ceremony Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai, Vice Chancellor SMIU said we are passing through hard times these days. Sindh and other provinces of the country have badly affected by heavy rains and floods, hence we all are worried for our countrymen. Thus, we are just remembering this historic day of SMIU’s life by organising a simple ceremony. The vice chancellor announced to donate his two days’ salary for rain and flood affected people and SMIU’s Endowment Fund respectively. The vice chancellor advised to SMIU employees to voluntarily donate for rain affected families, whatsoever they can. “If you donate one-day salary, half day salary, few hours or one-month salary, it’s up to you, but must support rain and flood victims,” the vice chancellor suggested. Paying rich tribute to the founder of SMI Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai said he was a real son of the soil and unsung hero of the land who established a modern educational institute for the nation as he was fully aware about the challenges the nation was facing in 19th century in the British colonial rule and had to face in coming days. “Unfortunately, a large number of our literate people are unware about the role and services of Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi,” he said and added that we must explore and share his great contribution towards modern education specially with our young generation to motivate them for the service of the country. Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai was of the view that when a child is born in a family, he/she brings a lot of happiness for them, but when an institution is built it brings happiness for a nation- and the institution can’t meet to a natural end like a human being but it can grow with the passage of time. He said we are custodian of SMIU, and its legacy, hence our sincere and honest efforts are needed for its progress and development. He opined that stable educational institutions are produced good results and good students, but the unstable institutions fail to serve the nation accordingly. Hence stability and strength of SMIU must be given priority. Dr. Mujeeb Sahrai said I have also a sentimental attachment with SMI as my father Mr. Taj Sahrai (who was a noted research scholar, historian and academician of Sindh) was its alumnus. He also lauded efforts of Director Directorate of Students Affairs and Counselling Dr. Asif Ali Wagan and his team for organising the event. Earlier, Dr. Asif Ali Wagan delivered welcome address and congratulated SMIU’s students, faculty and staff members on the SMIU’s foundation day and termed the SMIU a proud institution of the country. Dr. Zahid Ali Channar, Director Post Graduate Studies talked on the co-relation between education and economy and Ms. Nabila Kanwal, Principal of SMIU Model School reviewed the role of SMIU and SMIU Model School in the quality education. On the occasion students of the SMIU Model School delivered speeches in English, Urdu and Sindhi languages, in which they highlighted role of SMI’s founder Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi, SMIU’s alumnus Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, and Sindh Madressatul Islam, played for the nation and the country. Alumni of SMIU Sohail Khan Jadoon and Moomal Bughio also narrated their success stories, while success stories of SMIU Model School’s alumni were told to the audience too. The ceremony was attended by Advisor to Vice Chancellor on Academic Affairs, deans of different faculties, chairpersons, heads of various administrative departments, faculty, staff members and students.

Prof. Dr Mujeebuddin Sahrai Memon, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University has said pollution of all sorts, climate change, food scarcity, water shortage and increase in temperature has brought the earth in danger zone, hence everyone must play his/her role to normalize the environmental situation in the world. He said this while addressing the seminar organized by Department of Environmental Sciences and ORIC of Sindh Madressatul Islam University, in connection with the World Environmental Day, on Friday. Dr Sahrai said Pakistan has so many blessings and fortunes include strong solar and hydro system, four seasons, major crops, plains, river, sea and mountains. “When we couldn’t preserve our good things then how could we handle the difficulties,” the vice chancellor said and maintained that we are not rightly using our resources for development of the country. He said the younger population is Pakistan’s fortune, which is more than 50 percent of the total population of the country, but we have been failed to get them involved in the betterment of the country. He said currently we are living in a hazardous world, but younger generation should come forward and play their significant role in spreading awareness among masses including farmers about environmental issues. The Vice Chancellor said, in Sindh province Karachi city is more affected by the climate change. “Disasters come in seconds but recovering from the destruction takes years. Therefore, before meeting the disaster we must try to handle the issues seriously and consciously,” Dr Sahrai said. He advised the Department of Environment of Sindh Madressatul Islam University to form a waste management system in the campus, and work on the agenda that how can we keep clean and green to the university. Mr. Muhammad Umer Karim, water resources management specialist, who is working with UN-FAO talked on the environmental issues of Sindh with connection underground water issues. He said, in Sindh, river flow is decreasing due to increase in usage of underground water through tube wells on governmental as well as private level. “The natural flow of a river firstly maintains the underground water level, but it is causing low flow of water in the river,” he said. Mr. Umar Karim said we are producing good crops in Sindh, but rise in cash crops results in dried up of Indus River. He said before colonial era, there was a centuries old natural irrigation system in Sindh, which was environmental friendly. Looking back to his childhood, he said in his childhood days, people were getting sweet water by giving a cut to the land, but today about 80 to 85 percent water is saline. He said when the river is filled with water, then we are getting fresh underground water. “Indus River is our lifeline, but we had destroyed our environmental system by shortage of water,” he said and added that ground water availability in Sindh must be maintained up to 8 to 10-million-acre foot. Usage of more underground water will create geological problems too. Therefore, we should not over exploit underground water. He was of the view that floods and rains used to recharge a thin layer of aquifer, which used to be consumed throughout the year through hand pumps or dug Wells. The contiguous irrigation system raised the cropping intensities as well as ground water tables. Mr. Umer Karim further said the intensification of crops and further use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides has contaminated the resource base. We cannot directly use water for drinking purpose from any source place in the country. This is very deep environmental issue which needs proper research. He gave presentation on historical mapping of Ground Water in Sindh by M.H Panhwer, and Lower Indus Development Plan 1966. In last he encouraged the young students to adopt this topic for future research and diagnosis. Mr. Jibran Khalid Kidwai, environmentalist and social development consultant and alumni of SMI University, who is working on various national and international projects, emphasized that it is the time we should promote environmental education, inspire action, and renew and expand commitments to protect our planet, country and province. Mr. Jibran also updated the forum that Sindh will be leading province to launch first ever cleaner production policy by Sindh Environmental Protection Agency. He also said that specially in Sindh province there are very serious environmental issues including deforestation, urban and rural flooding, desertification and degradation of fresh water bodies. Later on, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam University gave away shields to the guests. Incharge chairperson of the Department of Environmental Sciences Dr Imran Ali thanked the guests.

National Agriculture Education Accreditation Council (NAEAC) chairperson, Prof. Dr. Ishtiaq A. Rajwana called upon higher education institutions to dedicate the 8th semester for full fledge internship. There should not be a short course, no parallel internship or classwork in the last semester. Ideally, internships should be paid and to find such internships should be the responsibility of the head of the departments and career placement officers. The universities that adopted this practice have had fruitful results.
He was addressing the 'NAEAC Quality Assurance and Accreditation Awareness Seminar' organized by the Department of Environmental Sciences, Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU).
While addressing the importance of curricula he said that the environmental sciences discipline might be on the radar of the National Curriculum Council of Pakistan in 2022. New and national curricula of Environmental sciences were going to emerge under academic pision.
He stated, “reputable organizations present themselves and ask the professional councils for third party evaluation voluntarily.” He said that before providing accreditation, they tried to organize awareness seminars, in which their experts guided the institutions so that they could complete the requirements to get accreditation.
“To prevent parents and students from any fraud we try to differentiate between legitimate and non-legitimate educational institutions so that children get rid of defaulter institutions,” said Dr. Rajwana.
The Vice chancellor, SMIU, Prof. Dr. Mujeebuddin Sahrai Memon concluded the seminar and said that usually people come and visit the institutions and concentrate on weaknesses and shortcomings but this time, he said, they received positive attitude.
“I felt quite comfortable while going through the parameters of accreditation council, and simultaneously, I was analyzing the university that fulfills the requirements,” said Dr. Sahrai, adding that he was hoping that in future visits of NAEAC they would do their best to receive W or X category.
He appreciated the inception of HEC and said the role and support of HEC shall be appreciated. Institutions like HEC were a blessing for us. If this institution did not exist, all the universities would be scattered.
On this occasion, Dr. Imran Chhajro, HoD of Environmental sciences gave a presentation on SMIU. Deans, Director ORIC, faculty, and students of the Department of Environmental Sciences were also present.

Speaking as the chief guest, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, also the chancellor of all public-sector universities in the province said that he has been attending convocations since the last three years and has observed how female students generally take all top positions. He said that this is to be seen whether girls are more intelligent than boys or do they take studies seriously and then why girls don’t pursue their careers in practical life. “This has become a dilemma of our society that as soon as girls get done with their education, they’re married off,” he said, adding that doing so all the hard work of girls, their struggles, and gold medals go in vain. 
The governor addressing the female students said that they should step out in the professional world and serve the nation as well. He said that students generally think that life after graduation is easy, “but let me tell your nothing is easy in life, you have to struggle.” 
The governor said that the federal government initiated Kamyab Nojawan Programme in Pakistan under which the youth will get an Rs50 carror load. “The students should bring in their ideas and achieve their dreams,” he said. 
Vice chancellor SMIU Prof. Dr. Mujeebuddin Sahrai Memon said that he felt highly content and pleased to congratulate his students and their proud parents for their presence in the wonderful convocation. “Indeed, it is a great pleasure to see my students clad in color gowns with smiles on their faces and fully prepared for take-off towards their bright career,” he said. 
He said that all stakes of the university; those are faculty, officers, and supporting staff, need to have a strong chemistry to produce a wonderful graduate, to produce a groomed person, to produce a human being, and henceforth to produce a responsible global citizen. “It is this connection that I preached at 5th Asia-Europe Rectors’ Conference held at the Czech Republic in 2016 that in the 21st-century institutes shall receive the students as their customers and send-off them as quality products. I and my faculty are pretty confident today that the product which we are sending in the mainstream of this country and global stream of the world will serve with utmost responsibility, integrity, and honesty.” 
The SMIU, he said, carries the legacy of 137 years with credit of producing visionary leadership, educationists, sports champions, rather I shall say icons of any field and top of everything the founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. However, being a university, we are just nine years old starting with five programs, 129 students, and around 150 faculty and staff, he said adding that currently they are running 16 programs, having a student population of 4000 with 87 faulty of which 40% Ph.D. and 222 supporting staff. He said that they have established their recognition and space at the provincial, national, and international levels.

**Introduction** Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015, too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs. As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work, education, and own less property. Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty. The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.
**Goals**
* By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions
* Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable
* By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance
* By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters
* Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programs and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions
* Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions

# SDG2: Zero Hunger

**Introduction** The number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half in the past two decades because of rapid economic growth and increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their nutritional needs. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have all made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger. Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. There are 821 million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017, often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation, drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five are dangerously underweight. Undernourishment and severe food insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all regions of Africa, as well as in South America. The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all people–especially children–have sufficient and nutritious food all year. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural, supporting small-scale farmers and equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity. **Goals**
* By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons
* By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment
* By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality
* By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed
* Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries
* Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round
Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.

**Introduction** We have made great progress against several leading causes of death and disease. Life expectancy has increased dramatically; infant and maternal mortality rates have declined, we’ve turned the tide on HIV and malaria deaths have halved. Good health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of the two. It takes into account widening economic and social inequalities, rapid urbanization, threats to the climate and the environment, the continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, and emerging challenges such as noncommunicable diseases. Universal health coverage will be integral to achieving SDG 3, ending poverty and reducing inequalities. Emerging global health priorities not explicitly included in the SDGs, including antimicrobial resistance, also demand action. But the world is off-track to achieve the health-related SDGs. Progress has been uneven, both between and within countries. There’s a 31-year gap between the countries with the shortest and longest life expectancies. And while some countries have made impressive gains, national averages hide that many are being left behind. Multisectoral, rights-based and gender-sensitive approaches are essential to address inequalities and to build good health for all. **Goals**
* By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births
* By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortalities to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births
* By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases
* By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being
* Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol
* By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents
* By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programs.
* Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all
* By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination
* Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate
* Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and non-communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the provisions in the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights regarding flexibilities to protect public health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all
* Substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries, especially in least developed countries and small island developing States
* Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks

**Introduction** Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. The total enrollment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half. There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more girls are in school than ever before. These are all remarkable successes. Progress has also been tough in some developing regions due to high levels of poverty, armed conflicts and other emergencies. In Western Asia and North Africa, ongoing armed conflict has seen an increase in the number of children out of school. This is a worrying trend. While Sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrollment among all developing regions – from 52 percent in 1990, up to 78 percent in 2012 – large disparities still remain. Children from the poorest households are up to four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural and urban areas also remain high. Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. This goal ensures that all girls and boys complete free primary and secondary schooling by 2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, to eliminate gender and wealth disparities, and achieve universal access to a quality higher education. **Goals**
* By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and Goal-4 effective learning outcomes
* By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and preprimary education so that they are ready for primary education
* By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university
* By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship
* By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations
* By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy
* By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development
* Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, nonviolent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all
* By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programs, in developed countries and other developing countries
* By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing states

# SDG5: Gender Equality
  * [Home](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/>)

![](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/about.jpg)
**Introduction** Ending all discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, it’s crucial for sustainable future; it’s proven that empowering women and girls helps economic growth and development. UNDP has made gender equality central to its work and we’ve seen remarkable progress in the past 20 years. There are more girls in school now compared to 15 years ago, and most regions have reached gender parity in primary education. But although there are more women than ever in the labour market, there are still large inequalities in some regions, with women systematically denied the same work rights as men. Sexual violence and exploitation, the unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work, and discrimination in public office all remain huge barriers. Climate change and disasters continue to have a disproportionate effect on women and children, as do conflict and migration. It is vital to give women equal rights land and property, sexual and reproductive health, and to technology and the internet. Today there are more women in public office than ever before, but encouraging more women leaders will help achieve greater gender equality.
**Goals**
* End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere
* Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation
* Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation
* Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate
* Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life
* Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Program of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences
* Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws
* Enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women
* Adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels

# SDG6: Clean Water and Sanitation
  * [Home](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/>)

  * [SDG6: Clean Water and Sanitation](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/sdg6-clean-water-and-sanitation>)

**Introduction** Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people, an alarming figure that is projected to rise as temperatures do. Although 2.1 billion people have improved water sanitation since 1990, dwindling drinking water supplies are affecting every continent. More and more countries are experiencing water stress, and increasing drought and desertification is already worsening these trends. By 2050, it is projected that at least one in four people will suffer recurring water shortages. Safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires we invest in adequate infrastructure, provide sanitation facilities, and encourage hygiene. Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems is essential. Ensuring universal safe and affordable drinking water involves reaching over 800 million people who lack basic services and improving accessibility and safety of services for over two billion. In 2015, 4.5 billion people lacked safely managed sanitation services (with adequately disposed or treated excreta) and 2.3 billion lacked even basic sanitations. **Goals**
* By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all
* By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
* By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally
* By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity
* By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate
* By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes
* By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies
* Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management

**Introduction** Between 2000 and 2018, the number of people with electricity increased from 78 to 90 percent, and the numbers without electricity dipped to 789 million. Yet as the population continues to grow, so will the demand for cheap energy, and an economy reliant on fossil fuels is creating drastic changes to our climate. Investing in solar, wind and thermal power, improving energy productivity, and ensuring energy for all is vital if we are to achieve SDG 7 by 2030. Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean and more efficient energy in all countries will encourage growth and help the environment. **Goals**
* By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services
* By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix
* By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency
* By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology
By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries.

# SDG8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

**Introduction** Over the past 25 years the number of workers living in extreme poverty has declined dramatically, despite the lasting impact of the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In developing countries, the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of total employment – a number that has almost tripled between 1991 and 2015. However, as the global economy continues to recover we are seeing slower growth, widening inequalities, and not enough jobs to keep up with a growing labour force. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015. The SDGs promote sustained economic growth, higher levels of productivity and technological innovation. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind, the goal is to achieve full and productive employment, and decent work, for all women and men by 2030. **Goals**
* Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries
* Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors
* Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services
* Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead
* By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value
* By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training
* Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms
* Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment
* By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products
* Strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all
* Increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries
By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labor Organizations.

**Introduction** Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies. Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges, such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. Promoting sustainable industries, and investing in scientific research and innovation, are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development. More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as foster innovation and entrepreneurship. **Goals**
* Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all
* Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries
* Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets
* By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities
* Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending
* Facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States 18
* Support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities
Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020.

# SDG10: Reduced Inequalities
  * [Home](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/>)
  * [sdgs](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs>)
  * [SDG10: Reduced Inequalities](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/sdg10-reduced-inequalities>)


![](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/about.jpg)
**Introduction**
* Income inequality is on the rise—the richest 10 percent have up to 40 percent of global income whereas the poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 to 7 percent. If we take into account population growth inequality in developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent.
* Income inequality has increased in nearly everywhere in recent decades, but at different speeds. It’s lowest in Europe and highest in the Middle East.
* These widening disparities require sound policies to empower lower income earners, and promote economic inclusion of all regardless of sex, race or ethnicity.
* Income inequality requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widening divide.
**Goals**
* By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average
* By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status
* Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard
* Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality
* Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and strengthen the implementation of such regulations
* Ensure enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions
* Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies
* Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements
* Encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to States where the need is greatest, in particular least developed countries, African countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their national plans and programs
* By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent

**Introduction** More than half of us live in cities. By 2050, two-thirds of all humanity—6.5 billion people—will be urban. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces. The rapid growth of cities—a result of rising populations and increasing migration—has led to a boom in mega-cities, especially in the developing world, and slums are becoming a more significant feature of urban life. Making cities sustainable means creating career and business opportunities, safe and affordable housing, and building resilient societies and economies. It involves investment in public transport, creating green public spaces, and improving urban planning and management in participatory and inclusive ways. **Goals**
* By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums
* By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons
* By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries
* Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage
* By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations
* By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management
* By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities
* Support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning
* By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement, in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, holistic disaster risk management at all levels
* Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient buildings utilizing local materials

# SDG12: Responsible Consumption and Production

**Introduction** Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide, and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater for human use. The efficient management of our shared natural resources, and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants, are important targets to achieve this goal. Encouraging industries, businesses and consumers to recycle and reduce waste is equally important, as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption by 2030. A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs. Halving the per capita of global food waste at the retailer and consumer levels is also important for creating more efficient production and supply chains. This can help with food security, and shift us towards a more resource efficient economy. **Goals**
* Implement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries
* By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources
* By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses
* By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment
* By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse
* Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle
* Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities
* By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature
* Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production
* Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products
* Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities.

# SDG13: Climate Action
  * [Home](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/sdgs/<https:/www.smiu.edu.pk/>)

**Introduction** There is no country that is not experiencing the drastic effects of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are more than 50 percent higher than in 1990. Global warming is causing long-lasting changes to our climate system, which threatens irreversible consequences if we do not act. The annual average economic losses from climate-related disasters are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. This is not to mention the human impact of geo-physical disasters, which are 91 percent climate-related, and which between 1998 and 2017 killed 1.3 million people, and left 4.4 billion injured. The goal aims to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries to both adapt to climate change and invest in low-carbon development. Supporting vulnerable regions will directly contribute not only to Goal 13 but also to the other SDGs. These actions must also go hand in hand with efforts to integrate disaster risk measures, sustainable natural resource management, and human security into national development strategies. It is still possible, with strong political will, increased investment, and using existing technology, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, aiming at 1.5°C, but this requires urgent and ambitious collective action. **Goals**
* Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
* Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning
* Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning
* Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible
* Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities.

**Introduction** The world’s oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents and life – drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole, and to counterbalance the effects of climate change. Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. However, today we are seeing 30 percent of the world’s fish stocks overexploited, reaching below the level at which they can produce sustainable yields. Oceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, and we are seeing a 26 percent rise in ocean acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Marine pollution, an overwhelming majority of which comes from land-based sources, is reaching alarming levels, with an average of 13,000 pieces of plastic litter to be found on every square kilometre of ocean. The SDGs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans. **Goals**
* By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution
* By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans
* Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels
* By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
* By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information
* By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation
* By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism
* Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries
* Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets
Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of The Future We Want

**Introduction** Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of the human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resources. Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth’s surface, provide vital habitats for millions of species, and important sources for clean air and water, as well as being crucial for combating climate change. Every year, 13 million hectares of forests are lost, while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares, disproportionately affecting poor communities. While 15 percent of land is protected, biodiversity is still at risk. Nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants have been illegally traded. Wildlife trafficking not only erodes biodiversity, but creates insecurity, fuels conflict, and feeds corruption. Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of our common heritage and support global food and water security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and peace and security. **Goals**
* By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements
* By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally
* By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world
* By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development
* Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species
* Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed
* Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products
* By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species
* By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts
* Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems
* Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, including for conservation and reforestation
* Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities

**Introduction** We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace, stability, human rights and effective governance, based on the rule of law. Yet our world is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy peace, security and prosperity, while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is not inevitable and must be addressed. Armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country’s development, affecting economic growth, and often resulting in grievances that last for generations. Sexual violence, crime, exploitation and torture are also prevalent where there is conflict, or no rule of law, and countries must take measures to protect those who are most at risk The SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence, and work with governments and communities to end conflict and insecurity. Promoting the rule of law and human rights are key to this process, as is reducing the flow of illicit arms and strengthening the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance. **Goals**
* Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere
* End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children
* Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all
* By 2030, significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime
* Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms
* Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels
* Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels
* Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance
* By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration
* Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements
* Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime
* Promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies for sustainable development

**Introduction** The SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnerships and cooperation. Official Development Assistance remained steady but below target, at US$147 billion in 2017. While humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters continue to demand more financial resources and aid. Many countries also require Official Development Assistance to encourage growth and trade. The world is more interconnected than ever. Improving access to technology and knowledge is an important way to share ideas and foster innovation. Coordinating policies to help developing countries manage their debt, as well as promoting investment for the least developed, is vital for sustainable growth and development. The goals aim to enhance North-South and South-South cooperation by supporting national plans to achieve all the targets. Promoting international trade, and helping developing countries increase their exports is all part of achieving a universal rules-based and equitable trading system that is fair and open and benefits all. **Goals**
* Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection
* Developed countries to implement fully their official development assistance commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of ODA/GNI to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries ODA providers are encouraged to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries
* Mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources
* Assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief and debt restructuring, as appropriate, and address the external debt of highly indebted poor countries to reduce debt distress
* Adopt and implement investment promotion regimes for least developed countries 
**Technology**
* Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through improved coordination among existing mechanisms, in particular at the United Nations level, and through a global technology facilitation mechanism
* Promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed
* Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation capacity-building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology 
**Capacity building**
* Enhance international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building in developing countries to support national plans to implement all the sustainable development goals, including through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation 
**Trade**
* Promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization, including through the conclusion of negotiations under its Doha Development Agenda
* Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ share of global exports by 2020
* Realize timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with World Trade Organization decisions, including by ensuring that preferential rules of origin applicable to imports from least developed countries are transparent and simple, and contribute to facilitating market access 
**Systemic issues** Policy and institutional coherence
* Enhance global macroeconomic stability, including through policy coordination and policy coherence
* Enhance policy coherence for sustainable development
* Respect each country’s policy space and leadership to establish and implement policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development 
**Multi-stakeholder partnerships**
* Enhance the global partnership for sustainable development, complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources, to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries, in particular developing countries
* Encourage and promote effective public, public-private and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships 
**Data, monitoring and accountability**
* By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts
* By 2030, build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product, and support statistical capacity-building in developing countries

**Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah (** The Founder of Pakistan**)**
Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah is one of the rare personalities of human history who is credited with the creation of a new country on the map of the world. He led the Muslim community of the subcontinent to carve out for themselves the largest, independent, and free Muslim state in the world. The creation of Pakistan at his hands in 1947 set into motion the liberation movements all over the world to shun off the yoke of colonialism. And within the next ten to fifteen years, more than thirty new Muslim states appeared on the map of the world. Besides, Jinnah was one of India’s leading legislators and constitutionalists. He was also one of the most remarkable legal practitioners of undivided India. Above all, he was a great man who set an example by bequeathing most of his personal property to various educational institutions including Sindh Madressatul Islam through his last will.

**Khan Bahadur Hassanally Effendi (** The Founder of Sindh Madressatul Islam)
Hassanally Effendi was born on 14th August 1830 in a respectable family of Akhunds in Hyderabad, Sindh. While still very young, he lost his father and was brought up by his elder brother. According to the tradition of his family, he was enrolled in a local ‘ _Maktab’_ to read the Holy Quran and learn Arabic and Persian. Hassanally’s dream to establish an educational institution came true on 1st September 1885, when Sindh Madressatul Islam was formally founded. A ceremony was arranged to mark the beginning of the institution, to which he invited a couple of friends and well-wishers. Hassanally spoke for about two hours in that function in which he described the social and economic conditions of the Muslims of Sindh and they took measures to improve the educational status of the Muslims of Sindh. By 1895, Hassanally Effendi and his friends in the cause had turned the institution of Sindh Madressatul Islam into a center of excellence. It consisted of a high school, three primary branches of Sindhi, Urdu, and Gujarati. In this institution, the Holy Quran classes and religious instructions were given regularly. A group of highly dedicated teachers had converted themselves into a spirited team around the dream of Hassanally Effendi. The institution had already started producing the generations of educated Sindhi Muslims, with the first batch of six students passing the examination conducted by the University of Bombay in 1892.

The aims of co-curricular activities other than academics are pertinent to students’ life as they contribute to their success in and outside the school. In fostering the strength of children, it is important to help young people steer away from undesirable behavior. Co-curricular activities lead to a higher self esteem. Such activities promote positive characteristics in students as they move into adult life. For co-curricular activities, it is necessary that teachers and students take on various responsibilities which enhance their leadership skills.

###### Principal’s Message
![](https://www.smiu.edu.pk/themes/smiu/images/principaal.jpg)
A very warm welcome to all. I encourage to all living souls of SMI University Model School who are contributing in the growth and welfare of the state. It is one of the oldest schools in Pakistan. SMI University has a rich history. It continues to uphold the traditional values while adopting contemporary infrastructure and pedagogies.
We believe that all good education has always been learner-centered, giving primacy to child’s inquisitiveness. We develop in them motivation as strong driving force for the attainment of their loftiest dreams and decision power to look at things critically and take right decisions at the right time.
We inculcate in the minds and hearts of the children; respect and honor and develop tolerance in them to bear hardships of life. We strive hard to cultivate in them an attitude for learning and growth, a curiosity for the growth and capacity to accept and appreciate cultural differences. This edifice and temple of learning will always be a source of never ending inspiration for our students. Our staff dedicatedly works hard to achieve the settled goals. It is because of their noble and relentless efforts that the school has been improving and achieving the objectives at broader level. I am confident that you all will be kind and generous in sharing what you have learnt, observed and experienced here and out of SMIU Model School that will be rewarding for us socially and intellectually. More complicated globally challenging environment is waiting for the new generation. We are here to prepare you for the better future. Wishing you all a good time here.

**Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence – BSAI**
**Proposed Study Plan BS (Artificial Intelligence) 4-Year Program (8 Regular Semester of 18 weeks each) (130 Credit Hours)**
**Program Structure**
The BS (AI) program gives the students an in-depth knowledge they need to transform large and complex scenarios into actionable decisions. The program and its curriculum focuses on how complex inputs — such as knowledge, vision, language and huge databases — can be used to make decisions to enhance human capabilities. The curriculum of the BS (AI) program includes coursework in computing, mathematics, automated reasoning, statistics, computational modeling, introduction to classical artificial intelligence languages and case studies, knowledge representation and reasoning, artificial neural networks, machine learning, natural language processing, vision and symbolic computation. The program also encourages students to take courses in ethics and social responsibility, with the opportunity to participate in long term projects in which artificial intelligence can be applied to solve problems that can change the world for the better — in areas like agriculture, defense, healthcare, governance, transportation, e-commerce, finance and education. Proposed Curriculum for BS (AI) Following are the proposed areas which are required to be covered to complete the degree.

## Undergraduate / Graduate Academic Regulation
###### Academic Year
There will be two regular semesters (Fall and Spring) in an academic year. Each semester will spread over 16-18 weeks (inclusive of 1 - 2 weeks for exams).SMIU may enroll students (if they fulfill SMIU enrollment criteria) for any semester or for any single course and will issue transcript with letter grade(s) at the end of that semester.
###### Summer Semester
* A student who has either failed or has been stopped to take the examination due to shortage of attendance or wishes to improve his/her grade is allowed to register in summer semester.
* A student will only be allowed to register maximum of 2 courses (of 6 credit hours).
* The contact hours per week during the Summer Semester will be adjusted accordingly to ensure that the course is completely taught in a summer session as compared to a regular (Fall/Spring) semester (i.e. total duration will be at least 48 hours including final examination).
## Academic Load
###### Undergraduate Students:
Students are expected to be enrolled on a full-time basis. To be considered a fulltime undergraduate degree candidate, a student must be registered in a minimum of five courses (15 Credit Hours). Students ordinarily are expected to proceed at the rate of 18 credits per semester.
Enrollment in fewer than five courses (15 credits) in any regular semester (Fall / Spring) requires advance approval. Student may enroll for more than 18 credit hours if his/her CGPA is above 3.5 or in case of repeating/failed/dropped course or if he/she is graduating student.
###### Graduate Students

Students may not be allowed to add/drop a course after the end of the second week of the semester.
Students may be allowed to withdraw from a course during 6th week of the semester (Academic Calendar will reflect these dates). In such a case the transcript shall record that the student enrolled in the course and withdrew. Consequently, grade “W” will be awarded to the student, which will have no impact on the calculation of the GPA of the student.

* If a student is not enrolled in any course in a semester then he/she will not be considered a regular student of University in that period. The student may then enroll in these courses in a subsequent semester; however, he/she will have to meet pre-requisites of any course taken. In addition, it is understood that the University is not required to offer all courses in each semester.
###### Student Assessment 
* In each semester, students may be required to appear in quizzes, midterms, final examinations, presentations (individual/group), group discussion, and submit projects/assignments/lab reports. These assessment marks (to be determined by the teacher concerned) will have different weight-age (depending on course to course) contributing towards the overall assessment in percent marks. The weight-age at SMIU is based on following criteria.
